    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN ASTRONOMER WITHOUT A TELESCOPE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton, &ldquo;what is marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Phyllis. She knew that her father had become possessed of a
      phrase, and that he was anxious to flutter it before her to see how it
      went. He was a connoisseur in the bric-a-brac of phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage means all your eggs in one basket,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed Phyllis once more. She wondered if her father really thought
      that she would be comforted in her great grief by a phrase. She did not
      want to know how marriage might be defined. She knew that all definitions
      are indefinite. She knew that in the case of marriage everything depends
      upon the definer and the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you see there is no immediate cause to grieve, my dear,&rdquo; resumed her
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not quite see that this was the logical conclusion of the whole
      matter; but that was possibly because she was born a woman, and felt that
      marriage is to a woman what a keel is to a ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is a very good cause to grieve when we find a man like
      George Holland turning deliberately round from truth to falsehood,&rdquo; said
      Phyllis sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s worse, running a very good chance of losing his living,&rdquo;
       remarked the father. &ldquo;Of course it will have to be proved that Moses and
      Abraham and David and the rest of them were not what he says they were;
      and it strikes me that all the bench of bishops, and a royal commissioner
      or two thrown in, would have considerable difficulty in doing that
      nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! You take his part, papa?&rdquo; she cried, starting up. &ldquo;You take his
      part? You think I was wrong to tell him&mdash;what I did tell him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t take his part, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton. &ldquo;I think that he&rsquo;s a
      bit of a fool to run his head into a hornet&rsquo;s nest because he has come to
      the conclusion that Abraham&rsquo;s code of morality was a trifle shaky, and
      that Samson was a shameless libertine. Great Heavens! has the man got no
      notion of the perspective of history?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perspective? History? It&rsquo;s the Bible, papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indignation was in Phyllis&rsquo; eyes, but there was a reverential tone in her
      voice. Her father looked at her&mdash;listened to her. In the pause he
      thought:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! What sort of a man is George Holland, who is ready to
      relinquish the love and loveliness of that girl, simply because he thinks
      poorly of the patriarchs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He attacks the Bible, papa,&rdquo; resumed Phyllis gravely. &ldquo;What horrible
      things he said about Ruth!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, Ruth&mdash;the heroine of the harvest festival,&rdquo; said her
      father. &ldquo;Ah, he might have left us our Ruth. Besides, she was a woman.
      Heavens above! is there no chivalry remaining among men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if it was only chivalry! But&mdash;the Bible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so&mdash;the&mdash;yes, to be sure. But don&rsquo;t you think you may
      take the Bible too seriously, Phyllis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, papa! too seriously?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? That&rsquo;s George Holland&rsquo;s mistake, I fear. Why should he work
      himself to a fury over the peccadillos of the patriarchs? The principle of
      the statute of limitations should be applied to such cases. If the world,
      and the colleges of theology, have dealt lightly with Samson and David and
      Abraham and Jacob and the rest of them for some thousands of years, why
      should George Holland rake up things against them, and that, too, on very
      doubtful evidence? But I should be the last person in the world to
      complain of the course which he has seen fit to adopt, since it has left
      you with me a little longer, my dearest child. I did not, of course,
      oppose your engagement, but I have often asked myself what I should do
      without you? How should I ever work up my facts, or, what is more
      important, my quotations, in your absence, Phyllis? On some questions, my
      dear, you are a veritable Blue-book&mdash;yes, an <i>edition de luxe</i>
      of a Blue-book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I meant to be so useful to him as well,&rdquo; said Phyllis, taking her
      father&rsquo;s praises more demurely than she had taken his phrases. &ldquo;I meant to
      help him in his work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, what a fool the man is! How could any man in his senses give up a
      thing of flesh and blood like you, for the sake of proving or trying to
      prove, that some people who lived five or six thousand years ago&mdash;if
      they ever lived at all&mdash;would have rendered themselves liable to
      imprisonment, without the option of a fine, if they lived in England since
      the passing of certain laws&mdash;recent laws, too, we must remember!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, you have done with him, my dear. A man who can&rsquo;t see that crime
      is really a question of temperament, and sin invariably a question of
      geography&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll say no more about it. At what hour did you say
      he was coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Four. I don&rsquo;t think I shall break down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Break down? Why on earth should you break down? You have a mind to know,
      and you know your own mind. That&rsquo;s everything. But of course you&rsquo;ve had no
      experience of matters of this sort. He was your first real lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis&rsquo; face became crimson. She retained sufficient presence of mind,
      however, to make a little fuss with the window-blind before letting it
      down. Her father stared at her for a moment, and there was rather a long
      pause before he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said &lsquo;real lover,&rsquo; my dear,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;The real lover is the one
      who talks definitely about dates and the house agent&rsquo;s commission. As a
      rule the real lover does not make love. True love is born, not made. But
      you&mdash;Heavens above! perhaps I did an injustice to you&mdash;to you
      and to the men. Maybe you&rsquo;re not such a tyro after all, Phyllis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis gave a very pretty little laugh&mdash;such a laugh as would have
      convinced any man but a father&mdash;perhaps, indeed, some fathers&mdash;that
      she was not without experience. Suddenly she became grave. Her father
      never loved her so dearly as when that little laugh was flying over her
      face, leaving its living footprints at the corners of her eyes, at the
      exquisite curve of her mouth. It relieved her from the suspicion of
      priggishness to which, now and again, her grave moods and appropriate
      words laid her open. She was not so proper, after all, her father now
      felt; she was a girl with the experiences of a girl who has tempted men
      and seen what came of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a very serious thing, giving a man your promise and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then finding that your duty to him&mdash;to him, mind&mdash;forces you to
      tell him that you cannot carry out that promise,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;Yes,
      it is a very serious thing, but not so serious as carrying out that
      promise would be if you had even the least little feeling that at the end
      of three months he was not a better man than you suspected he was at the
      beginning. There&rsquo;s a bright side to everything, even a honeymoon; but the
      reason that a honeymoon is so frequently a failure is because the man is
      bound to be found out by his wife inside the month. It is better that you
      found out now, than later on, that you could not possibly be happy with a
      man who spoke slightingly of the patriarchs and their wives. Now I&rsquo;ll
      leave you, with confidence that you will be able to explain matters to Mr.
      Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you won&rsquo;t be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dismay was in the girl&rsquo;s face as she spoke. She had clearly looked for the
      moral support of her father&rsquo;s presence while she would be making her
      explanation to the man whom she had, a few months before, promised to
      marry, but whom she had found it necessary to dismiss by letter, owing to
      her want of sympathy in some of his recent utterances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have unfortunately an engagement just at that hour, Phyllis,&rdquo;
       replied Mr. Ayrton. &ldquo;But do you really think there is any need for me to
      be here? Personally, I fancy that my presence would only tend to
      complicate matters. Your own feeling, your own woman&rsquo;s instinct, will
      enable you to explain&mdash;well, all that needs explanation. I have more
      confidence in your capacity to explain since you gave that pretty little
      laugh just now. Experience&mdash;ah, the experience of a girl such as you
      are, suggests an astronomer without a telescope. Still, there were
      astronomers before there were telescopes; and so I leave you, my beloved
      child&mdash;ah, my own child once again! No cold hand of a lover is now
      between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he was some distance down Piccadilly that it occurred to
      him that he should have pictured the lover with a warm hand; and that
      omission on his part caused him a greater amount of irritation than anyone
      who was unaware of his skill in phrase-making could have thought possible
      to arise from a lapse apparently so trifling.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he had reached the Acropolis and had referred, in the
      hearing of the most eminently dull of the many distinguished members of
      that club, to the possibility of a girl&rsquo;s experiences of man being likened
      to an astronomer without a telescope, that he felt himself again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dull distinguished man had smiled.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HE KNEW THAT IT WAS A TROUBLESOME PROCESS, BECOMING A GOOD CLERGYMAN, SO
      HE DETERMINED TO BECOME A GOOD PREACHER INSTEAD.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis sat alone in one of the drawing rooms, waiting until the hour of
      four should arrive and bring into her presence the Rev. George Holland, to
      plead his cause to her&mdash;to plead to be returned to her favor. He had
      written to her to say that he would make such an attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had looked on him with favor for several months&mdash;with especial
      favor for three months, for three months had just passed since she had
      promised to marry him, believing that to be the wife of a clergyman who,
      though still young, had two curates to do the rough work for him&mdash;clerical
      charwomen, so to speak&mdash;would make her the happiest of womankind. Mr.
      Holland was rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s, Battenberg Square, and he was thought
      very highly of even by his own curates, who intoned all the commonplace,
      everyday prayers in the liturgy for him, leaving him to do all the
      high-class ones, and to repeat the Commandments. (A rector cannot be
      expected to do journeyman&rsquo;s work, as it were; and it is understood that a
      bishop will only be asked to intone three short prayers, those from behind
      a barrier, too; an archbishop refuses to do more than pronounce the
      benediction.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. George Holland was a good-looking man of perhaps a year or two
      over thirty. He did not come of a very good family&mdash;a fact which
      probably accounted for his cleverness at Oxford and in the world. He was a
      Fellow of his college, though he had not been appointed rector of St.
      Chad&rsquo;s for this reason. The appointment, as is well known (in the Church,
      at any rate), is the gift of the Earl of Earlscourt, and it so happened
      that, when at college together, George Holland had saved the young man who
      a year or two afterward became Earl of Earlscourt from a very great
      misfortune. The facts of the case were these: Tommy Trebovoir, as he was
      then, had made up his mind to marry a lady whose piquant style of beauty
      made the tobacconist&rsquo;s shop where she served the most popular in town. By
      the exercise of a great deal of diplomacy and the expenditure of a little
      money, Mr. Holland brought about a match between her and quite another man&mdash;a
      man who was not even on a subsidiary path to a peerage, and whose only
      connection with the university was due to his hiring out horses to those
      whom he called the &ldquo;young gents.&rdquo; Tommy was so indignant with his friend
      for the part he had played in this transaction he ceased to speak to him,
      and went the length of openly insulting him. Six years afterward, when he
      had become Earl of Earlscourt, and had espoused the daughter of a duke,&mdash;a
      lady who was greatly interested in the advance of temperance,&mdash;he had
      presented George Holland with the living at St. Chad&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      People then said that Lord Earlscourt was a lesser fool than some of his
      acts suggested. Others said that the Rev. George Holland had never been a
      fool, though he had been a Fellow of his college.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were right. George Holland knew that it was a troublesome process
      becoming a good clergyman, so he determined to become a good preacher
      instead. In the course of a year he had become probably the best-known
      preacher (legitimate, not Dissenting) in London, and that, too, without
      annoying the church-wardens of St. Chad&rsquo;s by drawing crowds of undesirable
      listeners to crush their way into the proprietary sittings, and to join in
      the singing and responses, and to do other undesirable acts. No, he only
      drew to the church the friends of the said holders, whose contributions to
      the offertory were exemplary.
    </p>
    <p>
      His popularity within a certain circle was great; but, as Lord Earlscourt
      was heard to say, &ldquo;He never played to the pit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was invited to speak to a resolution at a Mansion House meeting to
      express indignation at the maintenance of the opium traffic in China.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also invited by the Countess of Earlscourt to appear on the
      platform to meet the deputation of Chinese who represented the city
      meeting held at Pekin in favor of local option in England; for the great
      national voice of China had pronounced in favor of local option in
      England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterward he met Phyllis Ayrton, and had asked her to marry him,
      and she had consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Phyllis was awaiting his coming to her, in order that he might
      learn from her own lips what he had already learned from the letter which
      he had received from her the day before; namely, that she found it
      necessary for her own peace of mind to break off her engagement with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis Ayrton had felt for some months that it would be a great privilege
      for any woman to become the wife of a clergyman. Like many other girls who
      have a good deal of time for thought,&mdash;thought about themselves,
      their surroundings, and the world in general,&mdash;she had certain
      yearnings after a career. But she had lived all her life in Philistia, and
      considered it to be very well adapted as a place of abode for a
      proper-minded young woman; in fact, she could not imagine any
      proper-minded young woman living under any other form of government than
      that which found acceptance in Philistia. She had no yearning to startle
      her neighbors. With a large number of young women, the idea that startling
      one&rsquo;s neighbors is a career by itself seems to prevail just at present;
      but Phyllis had no taste in this direction. Writing a book and riding a
      bicycle were alike outside her calculations of a scheme of life. Hospital
      nursing was nothing that she would shrink from; at the same time, it did
      not attract her; she felt that she could dress quite as becomingly as a
      hospital nurse in another way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered, if it should come to the knowledge of the heads of the
      government of Philistia that she had a yearning to become the wife of a
      clergyman, would they regard her as worthy to be conducted across the
      frontier, and doomed to perpetual expatriation. When she began to think
      out this point, she could not but feel that if she were deserving of
      punishment,&mdash;she looked on expulsion from Philistia as the severest
      punishment that could be dealt out to her, for she was extremely
      patriotic,&mdash;there were a good many other young women, and women who
      were no longer young, who were equally culpable. She had watched the faces
      of quite a number of the women who crowded St. Chad&rsquo;s at every service,
      and she had long ago come to the conclusion that the desire to become the
      wife of a clergyman was an aspiration which was universally distributed
      among the unmarried women of the congregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew so much, but she was not clever enough to know that it was her
      observance of this fact that confirmed her in her belief that it would be
      a blessed privilege for such a woman as she to become the wife of such a
      clergyman as George Holland. She was not wise enough to be able to
      perceive that a woman marries a man not so much because she things highly
      of marriage&mdash;although she does think highly of it; not so much
      because she thinks highly of the man&mdash;though she may think highly of
      him, but simply because she sees that other women want to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three months she considered herself blessed among women. She was the
      one chosen out of all the flock. She did not look around her in church in
      pride of conquest; but she looked demurely down to her sacred books,
      feeling that all the other women were gazing at her in envy; and she felt
      that there was no pride in the thought that the humility of her attitude&mdash;downcast
      eyes, with long lashes shading half her cheeks, meekly folded hands&mdash;was
      the right one to adopt under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she saw several of the young women who had been wearing sober
      shades of dresses for some years,&mdash;though in their hearts (and she
      knew it) they were passionately attached to colors,&mdash;appearing like
      poppies once more, and looking very much the better for the change, too;
      and she felt that it was truly sad for young women to&mdash;well, to show
      their hands, so to speak. They might have waited for some weeks before
      returning to the colors of the secular.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know that they felt that they had wasted too much time in
      sober shades already. The days are precious in a world in which no really
      trustworthy hair dye may be bought for money.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there came to her a month of coldly inquisitive doubt. (This was
      when people had ceased to congratulate her and to talk, the nice ones, of
      the great cleverness of George Holland; the nasty ones, of the great pity
      that so delightful a man did not come of a better family.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should she begin to ask herself if she really loved George Holland; if
      the feeling she had for him should be called by the name of love, or by
      some other name that did not mean just the same thing? Of course she had
      thought a good deal&mdash;though her father did not know it&mdash;of love.
      She had seen upon other people the effect of the possession of this gift
      of love, how it had caused them to forget pain and poverty, and shame, and
      infamy, and God, and death, and hell. Ah! that was love&mdash;that was
      love! and she had hoped that one day such a gift of love would be given to
      her; for it was surely the thing that was best worth having in the world!
      Once or twice she had fancied that it was at the point of being given to
      her. There had been certain thrilling passages between herself and two
      men,&mdash;an interval of a year between each,&mdash;and there had also
      been a kiss in an alcove designed by her dearest friend, Ella Linton, for
      the undoing of mankind, a place of softened lights and shadowy palms. It
      was her recollection of these incidents that had caused her to fumble with
      the blind cord when her father had been suggesting to her the
      disadvantages of inexperience in matters of the heart. But the incidents
      had led to nothing, except, perhaps, a week or two of remorse. But she
      could not help feeling, when that month of curious doubt was upon her,
      that the little thrill which she had felt when one man had put his arm
      around her for an instant, when another man&mdash;he was very young&mdash;had
      put his lips upon her mouth&mdash;it was a straightforward kiss&mdash;suggested
      a nearer approach to love than she had yet been conscious of in the
      presence of George Holland. (He had never done more than kiss her hand. Is
      it on record that any man did more when dressed with the severity of the
      cleric?)
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a terrible impression for a young woman to retain before her
      engagement to a man has passed into its third month. Then she began to
      wonder if all her previous ideas&mdash;all her previous aspirations&mdash;were
      mistaken. She began to wonder if this was the reality of love&mdash;this
      conviction that there was nothing in the whole world that she would
      welcome with more enthusiasm than an announcement on the part of her
      father that he was going on a voyage to Australia, and that he meant to
      take her with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, then she threw herself upon her bed and wept for an hour one
      evening, and for two hours (at intervals) another evening; and then looked
      up the old published speeches made by a certain cabinet minister in his
      irresponsible days, on a question which he had recently introduced. Her
      father was bitterly opposed to the most recent views of the minister, and
      was particularly anxious to confront him with his own phrases of thirty
      years back. She spent four hours copying out the words which were now
      meant by Mr. Ayrton to confound the utterer.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      THE BISHOP KNEW SOMETHING OF MAN, AND HE KNEW SOMETHING OF THE CHURCH; HE
      EVEN KNEW SOMETHING OF THE BIBLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father when he came in commended her diligence. He read over those
      damning extracts, punctuating them with chuckles; he would make an example
      of that minister who had found it convenient to adopt a course
      diametrically opposed to the principle involved in his early speeches. He
      chuckled, reading the extracts while he paced the room, drawing upon his
      stock of telling phrases, which were calculated to turn the derision of
      the whole House of Commons upon his opponent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, being very well satisfied with himself, he was satisfied with her,
      and kissed her, with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a treasure you are to me, dearest one!&rdquo; he said. There was a pause
      before he added, in a contemplative tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose a clergyman has no need ever to hunt up the past deliverances
      of another clergyman in order to confound him out of his own mouth. Ah,
      no; I should fancy not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Regret was in his voice. He seemed to suggest to her that he believed her
      powers would be wasted as the wife of a man who, of course, being a
      clergyman, could have no enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest papa!&rdquo; she cried, throwing herself into his arms, and sobbing on
      his shirt front, &ldquo;dearest papa, I will not leave you. I don&rsquo;t want to be
      anyone&rsquo;s wife. I want to be your daughter&mdash;only to be your daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He comforted her with kisses and soothing smoothings of the hair. No, no,
      he said; he would not be selfish. He would remember that a father was the
      trustee of his child&rsquo;s happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I know I can only be happy with you, my father!&rdquo; she cried; but it
      was of no avail. He, being a father and not a mother, was unable to
      perceive what was in the girl&rsquo;s heart. He considered it quite natural that
      she should be a trifle hysterical in anticipating her new life&mdash;that
      strange untraveled country! Ah, is there anything more pathetic, he
      thought, than a girl&rsquo;s anticipations of wifehood? But he would do his
      duty, and he fancied that he was doing his duty when he put aside her
      earnest, almost passionate protestations, and told her how happy she would
      be with the man who was lucky enough to have won the pure treasure of her
      love.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could she do? The terrible doubts of that month of doubting broadened
      into certainties. She knew that she did not love George Holland; but she
      had not the courage to face Philistia as the girl who did not know her own
      mind. Philistia was very solid on such points as the sacredness of an
      engagement between a man and a woman. It was a contract practically as
      abiding as marriage, in the eyes of Philistia; and, indeed, Phyllis
      herself had held this belief, and had never hesitated to express it. So
      nothing was left to her but to marry George Holland. After all, he was a
      brilliant and distinguished man, and had not a score of other girls wanted
      to marry him? Oh, she would marry him and give up her life to the splendid
      duties which devolve upon the wife of a clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just as she had made up her mind to face her fate, Mr. Holland&rsquo;s fate
      induced him to publish the book at which he had been working for some
      time. It came out just when the girl was becoming resigned to her future
      by his side, and it attracted even more attention than the author had
      hoped it would achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book was titled &ldquo;Revised Versions,&rdquo; and it was strikingly modern in
      design and in tone. It purported to deal with several personages and
      numerous episodes of the Old Testament, not from the standpoint of the
      comparative philologist; not from the standpoint of the comparative
      mythologist, but from the standpoint of the modern man of common sense and
      average power of discrimination; and the result was that the breath of a
      good many people, especially clergymen, was taken from them, and that the
      Rev. George Holland became the best-known clergyman in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dealt with the patriarchs in succession, and they fared very badly at
      his hands. He showed that Abraham had not one good act recorded to his
      credit, and contrasted his duplicity with the magnanimity of the ruler of
      Egypt whom he visited. He dwelt upon the Hagar episode, showing that the
      adulterer was also a murderer by intention, and so forth; while no words
      could be too strong to apply to Sara, his wife. Isaac did not call for
      elaborate notice. He could not be accused of any actual crime, but if he
      was a man of strong personality, he was singularly unfortunate in having
      failed to impart to his wife any of that integrity which he may have
      practiced through life. Her methods of dealing with him after they had
      lived together for a good many years were criminal, considering the
      largeness of the issue at stake as the result of his blessing. As for
      Jacob, not a single praiseworthy act of his long life was available to his
      biographer. His career was that of the most sordid of hucksters. Of eleven
      of his sons nothing good is told, but Joseph was undoubtedly an able and
      exemplary man; the only thing to his discredit being his utter callousness
      regarding the fate of his father, after he had attained to a high position
      in Egypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapter on the patriarchs was followed by one that dealt with the
      incidents of the Exodus. The writer said that he feared that even the most
      indulgent critic must allow that the whole scheme of Moses was a shocking
      one; but he was probably the greatest man that ever lived on the face of
      the earth, if he was the leader and organizer of a band of depredators who
      for bloodthirst and rapacity had no parallel in history. How could it be
      expected that a kingdom founded upon the massacre of men and cemented by
      the blood of women and children should survive? It had survived only as
      example to the world of the impossibility of a permanent success being
      founded upon the atrocious methods pursued by the worst of the robber
      states of the East. While civilization had been spreading on all sides of
      them, the people of Israel had remained the worst of barbarians, murdering
      the men who had from time to time arisen to try and rescue them from the
      abysses of criminality into which they had fallen,&mdash;abysses of
      criminality and superstition,&mdash;until they had filled their cup of
      crime by the murder of the One whom the world worships to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incidentally, of course, the character of Samson was dealt with. Delilah
      was shown to be one of the most heroic of womankind, making greater
      sacrifices through her splendid patriotism than Joan of Arc. But Samson&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruth was also dealt with incidentally. She was the woman who expresses her
      willingness to give up her God at the bidding of another woman, and who
      had entered into a plot with that same woman to entrap a man whom they
      looked to support them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was David. It was not the Bath-sheba episode, but the Abishag,
      that the author treated at length&mdash;one of the most revolting
      transactions in history, especially as there is some reason to believe
      that the unfortunate girl was, when it was perpetrated, already attached
      to one of the sons of the loathsome, senile sensualist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, on the whole, it was not surprising that after the publication of
      this book the Rev. George Holland became the best-known clergyman in
      England, or that the breath of bishops should be taken from them. So soon
      as some of them recovered from the first brunt of the shock, they met
      together and held up their hands, saying that they awaited the taking of
      immediate action by the prelate within whose see St. Chad&rsquo;s was situated.
      But that particular prelate was a man who had never been known to err on
      the side of rapidity of action. Nearly a week had passed before he made
      any move in the matter, and then the move he made was in the direction of
      the Engadine. He crossed the Channel with the book under his arm. He
      determined to read it at his leisure. Being a clergyman, he could not, of
      course, be expected to have examined, from any standpoint but that of the
      clergyman, the characters of the persons dealt with in the book, and he
      was naturally shocked at the freedom shown by the rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s in
      criticising men whose names have been held in the highest esteem for some
      thousands of years. He at once perceived that the rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s had
      been very narrow-minded in his views regarding the conduct of the men whom
      he had attacked. It occurred to him, as it had to Mr. Ayrton, that the
      writer had drawn his picture without any regard for perspective. That was
      very foolish on the part of a man who was a Fellow of his college, the
      bishop thought; and besides, there was no need for the book&mdash;its
      tendency was not to help the weaker brethren. But to assume that the book
      would, as some newspaper articles said it would, furnish the most powerful
      argument that had yet been brought forward in favor of the
      Disestablishment of Church, was, he thought, to assume a great deal too
      much. The Church that had survived Wesley, Whitefield, Colenso, Darwin,
      and Renan would not succumb to George Holland. The bishop recollected how
      the Church had bitterly opposed all the teaching of the men of wisdom
      whose names came back to him; and how it had ended by making their
      teaching its own. Would anyone venture to assert that the progress of
      Christianity was dependent upon what people thought of the acceptance by
      David of the therapeutic course prescribed for him? Was the morality which
      the Church preached likely to be jeopardized because Ruth was a tricky
      young woman?
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop knew something of man, and he knew something of the Church, he
      even knew something of the Bible; and when he came to the chapter in
      &ldquo;Revised Versions&rdquo; that dealt with the episode of Ruth and Boaz, he flung
      the book into a corner of his bedroom, exclaiming, &ldquo;Puppy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then there came before his eyes a vision of a field of yellow corn,
      ripe for the harvest. The golden sunlight gleamed upon the golden grain
      through which the half-naked brown-skinned men walked with their sickles.
      The half-naked brown-skinned women followed the binders, gleaning the
      ears, and among the women was the one who had said, &ldquo;Entreat me not to
      leave thee.&rdquo; He had read that old pastoral when he was a child at the knee
      of his mother. It was surely the loveliest pastoral of the East, and its
      charm would be in no wise impaired because a man who failed to appreciate
      the beauty of its simplicity, had almost called Ruth by the worst name
      that can be applied to a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop did not mind what George Holland called Abraham, or Isaac, or
      Jacob, or Samson, but Ruth&mdash;to say that Ruth&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop said &ldquo;Puppy!&rdquo; once again. (He had trained himself only to think
      the adjectives which laymen find appropriate to use in such a case as was
      under his consideration.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But he made up his mind to take no action whatever against the Rev. George
      Holland on account of the book. If the Rev. George Holland fancied that he
      was to be persecuted into popularity, the Rev. George Holland was greatly
      mistaken, and the bishop had a shrewd idea that the rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s
      was greatly mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      (It may be mentioned that he came to this determination when he had read
      the book through, and found it was so cleverly written that it included no
      heretical phrase in all its pages.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But so soon as Phyllis Ayrton had read the first review of the book that
      fell into her hands, she felt inexpressibly shocked. Great Heavens! Was it
      possible that she was actually at that moment engaged to marry the man who
      had written such a book&mdash;a book that held up Delilah to admiration,
      and that abased Ruth? (It was singular how everyone settled upon Ruth in
      this connection.)
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not pause to analyze her feelings&mdash;to try and find out if she
      was really so fond of Ruth as to make Ruth&rsquo;s insult her own; but without a
      moment&rsquo;s delay, without a word of consultation with her father, she sat
      down at her desk and wrote a letter to George Holland, asking him to
      release her from her promise to marry him; and adding that if he should
      decline to do so it would make no difference to her; she would consider
      the engagement between them at an end all the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt, when that letter was posted, as if a great weight were lifted
      from her mind&mdash;from her heart. Then a copy of &ldquo;Revised Versions&rdquo;
       arrived for her from the author, and with the ink still wet upon the pen
      with which she had written that letter to him, she caught up the book and
      covered it with kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he seen that action her lover would have been thoroughly satisfied. A
      young woman must be very deeply in love with a man when she kisses the
      cover of a book which he has just published. That is what George Holland
      would have thought, having but a superficial acquaintance with the motives
      that sway young women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later in the day he had replied to her letter, and had appointed four
      o&rsquo;clock on the following afternoon as the hour when he trusted she would
      find it convenient to see him, in order to give him an opportunity of
      making an explanation which he trusted would enable her to see that
      &ldquo;Revised Versions,&rdquo; so far from being the dreadful book she seemed to
      imagine it to be, was in reality written with a high purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not shrunk from an interview with him. She had sent him a line to
      let him know that she would be at home at four o&rsquo;clock; and now she sat in
      her drawing room and observed, without emotion, that in five minutes that
      hour would strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock struck, and before the last tone had died away, the footman
      announced the Rev. George Holland.

      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO ACCUSE HIM OF READING THE BIBLE DAILY.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Phyllis shook hands with her visitor. He sought to retain her hand, as he
      had been in the habit of doing, as he stood beside her with something of a
      proprietary air. He relinquished her hand with a little look of surprise&mdash;a
      sort of pained surprise. She was inexorable. She would not even allow him
      to maintain his proprietary air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do sit down, Mr. Holland,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! &lsquo;Mr. Holland&rsquo; already? Oh, Phyllis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had a good voice, full of expression&mdash;something beyond mere
      musical expression. People (they were mostly women) said that his voice
      had soul in it, whatever they meant by that.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply. What reply could she make? She only waited for him to
      sit down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your letter came as a great shock to me, Phyllis,&rdquo; said he, when he had
      seated himself, not too close to her. He did not wish her to fancy that he
      was desirous of having a subtle influence of propinquity as an ally. &ldquo;A
      great shock to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A shock?&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;A shock, after you had written that book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancied you would understand it, Phyllis&mdash;you, at least. Of course
      I expected to be misrepresented by the world&mdash;the critics&mdash;the
      clerics&mdash;what you will&mdash;but you&mdash;&mdash;You had not read it
      when you wrote that letter to me&mdash;that terrible letter. You could not
      have read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had only read one notice of it&mdash;that was enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you could write that letter to me solely as the evidence of one
      wretched print? Oh, Phyllis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pain was in his voice. It may have been in his face as well, but she did
      not see it; his face was averted from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said quietly; &ldquo;I wrote that letter, Mr. Holland. You see, the
      paper gave large extracts from the book. I did not come to my conclusion
      from what the newspaper article said, but from what you had said in your
      book&mdash;from the quoted passages.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did not do me justice. I did not look for justice at their hands.
      But you, Phyllis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have read your book now, Mr. Holland&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, let me plead with you, Phyllis&mdash;not &lsquo;Mr. Holland,&rsquo; I entreat of
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my first thought on reading it was that I had not written to you so
      strongly as I should have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Phyllis, do not say that, I beg of you. You cannot know how you
      pain me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be misunderstood by you&mdash;<i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She got upon her feet so quickly that it might almost be said she sprang
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i> must have misunderstood <i>me</i> greatly, Mr. Holland, if you
      fancied that you could write such a book as you wrote and not get such a
      letter from me. The Bible&mdash;Ruth&mdash;and you a clergyman&mdash;reading
      it daily in the church&mdash;&mdash;Oh! I cannot tell you all that I
      thought&mdash;all that I still think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not correct the mistake she had made. She had no right to accuse
      him of reading the Bible daily in his church. He was not in the habit of
      doing that&mdash;it was his curates who did it. He watched her as she
      stood at a window with her back turned to him. Her hands were behind her.
      Her breath came audibly, for she had spoken excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he also rose and came beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote that book, as I believed you would perceive when you had read it,
      in order to remove from the minds of the people&mdash;those people who
      have not given the matter a thought&mdash;the impression&mdash;I know it
      prevails&mdash;that our faith&mdash;the truth of our religion&mdash;is
      dependent upon the acceptance as good of such persons as our very religion
      itself enables us to pronounce evil. My aim was to show that our faith is
      not built upon such a foundation of impurity&mdash;of imperfection. The
      spirit which prevails nowadays&mdash;the modern spirit&mdash;it is the
      result of the development of science. This scientific spirit necessitates
      the consideration of all the elements of our faith from the standpoint of
      reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith&mdash;reason?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the Church is to appeal to all men, its method must be scientific. It
      is sad to think of all that the Church has lost in the past through the
      want of wisdom of those who had its best interests at heart, and believed
      they were doing it good service by opposing scientific research. They
      fancied that the faith would not survive the light of truth. They
      professed to believe that the faith was strong enough to work miracles&mdash;to
      change the heart of man, and yet that it would be jeopardized by the
      calculations of astronomers. The astronomers were prohibited from
      calculating; the geologists were forbidden to unearth the mysteries of
      their science, lest the discovery of the truth should be detrimental to
      the faith. They believed that the truth was opposed to the faith. Warning
      after warning the Church received that the two were one; that man would
      only accept the truth, whether it came from the lips of the churchman or
      from the investigations of science. Grudgingly the Church became tolerant
      of the seekers after truth&mdash;men who were not greatly concerned in the
      preservation of the mummy dust of dogma. But how many thousand persons are
      there not, to-day, who think that the Church is on one side, and the truth
      on the other? The intolerant attitude of the Church, still maintained in
      these days, when the spirit of science pervades every form of thought, has
      been productive of probably the largest body that ever existed in the
      country, of sensible men and women, who never enter a church door. They
      want to know whatsoever things are true; they do not want to be dredged
      with the mummy dust of dogma.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Bible&mdash;the Bible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is necessary for me to tell you all that I feel on this subject; all
      that I have felt for several years past&mdash;ever since I left the
      divinity school behind me, and went into the world of thinking men and
      women. It is necessary to tell these men and women in unmistakable
      language that our faith aims at a perfect type of manhood&mdash;at the
      perfection of truth. It is necessary to tell them that we do not regard,
      except with abhorrence, such types of men as have for centuries been held
      up to admiration simply because they have for centuries been the objects
      of admiration, of imitation, of veneration, on the part of the debased
      people who gave us the earlier books of the Bible. The memory of Jacob
      became the dominant influence among the Hebrew nation; hence the
      continuous curse that rested upon them, the curse that rests upon the
      cheat, the defrauder of his own household, his brother, his father, his
      uncle. It is necessary to say that the world should know that our religion
      is founded upon truth, purity, self-sacrifice&mdash;that it abhors the
      cheat and the sensualist. It is necessary to proclaim to the world our
      abhorrence of the cult whose highest development was the Pharisee. The aim
      of the religion of Christ is to produce the perfect man, and to root out
      the Pharisee. When the Church ceases to connive at falsehood and
      sensualism; when it openly professes its abhorrence of the religion of the
      Hebrews; then, and then only, will it become the power in the earth which
      the exponent of Christianity should become. Humanity had been crying out
      for the religion of humanity, that is, Christianity, for centuries, but
      the Church tells it that true religion is an amalgamation of the
      loveliness of Christianity and the barbarity of Judaism&mdash;an
      impossible amalgamation, and one which millions of poor souls have
      perished in a vain attempt to accomplish. Humanity wants Christ, and
      Christ only, and that the Church has hitherto refused to give; hence the
      millions of thinking men and women, believers in the religion of Christ,
      who remain forever outside the walls of the Church; hence, also, that
      terrible record of murder and massacre, perpetrated through long ages with
      the sanction of the Church. Where, in the religion of Christ, can one find
      the sanction for massacre? It is nowhere to be found except in the Psalms
      of the senile sensualist&mdash;in the commands of Moses, the leader of the
      marauders of the desert. Christ swept away the barbarities of the teaching
      of Moses. He perceived how miserably it had failed; how it had retarded
      all that was good in man, and sanctioned all that was evil. He perceived
      how it had kept the nation in a condition of barbarity; how it had made it
      the prey of the civilized nations around it; how it had made the Hebrew
      nations the contempt of civilization; and yet the Church that calls itself
      the Church of Christ has not yet had the courage to offer humanity
      anything but that impossible task&mdash;the amalgamation of the law that
      came by Moses and the grace and truth that came by Jesus Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with all the fervor of the preacher, with pale face, brilliant
      eyes, and clenched hands; but in a voice adapted to a drawing room.
      Phyllis of Philistia could not but admit that, in the phrase of Philistia
      he had spoken in perfect taste. He had not alluded definitely to the
      boldness of Ruth or to the calorific course accepted by the aged David. He
      had spoken in those general terms which are adopted by the clergymen who
      never err against good taste as defined by the matrons of Philistia.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know whether she admired him or detested him. But she was
      certain that she did not love him. He might be right in all that he had
      said, but she had freed herself from him. He might be destined to become
      one of the most prominent men of the last ten years of the century, but
      she would never marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood face to face with him when he had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gleam, a very faint gleam of triumph came to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said she, flashing out her hand to him, and with her eyes
      still fixed upon his face.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN LOVE THERE ARE NO GOOD-BYES.
    </h3>
    <p>
      He was so startled that he took a step backward. She remained with her
      hand outstretched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was that only the result of the eloquent expression of his views&mdash;that
      outstretched hand which was offered to him for an instant only as a symbol
      of its withdrawal from him forever?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not explained all that seemed to you to stand in need of
      explanation?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The book&mdash;the book remains. I asked for no explanation,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are too good, too reasonable, to dismiss me in this fashion,
      Phyllis. Why, even the bishop&mdash;<i>would sit upon a fence to see how
      the book would be received by the public before taking action against the
      author</i>,&rdquo; was what was in his mind, but he stopped short, and then
      added a phrase that had no reference to the bishop. &ldquo;Can you ever have
      loved me?&rdquo; was the phrase which he thought should appeal to her more
      forcibly than any reference to the bishop&rsquo;s sense of what was opportune.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took back her hand, and her eyes fell at the same moment that her face
      flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he had not been astray in his estimate of the controversial
      value&mdash;in the eyes of a girl, of course&mdash;of the appeal which he
      made to her. A girl understands nothing of the soundness of an argument on
      a Biblical question (or any other), he thought; but she understands an
      appeal made to her by a man whom she had loved, and whom she therefore
      loves still, though something may have occurred to make her think
      otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you ever have loved me?&rdquo; he said again, and his voice was now more
      reproachful.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause before she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the question which I have been asking myself for some time&mdash;ever
      since I read about that book. Oh, please, Mr. Holland, do not stay any
      longer! Cannot you see that if, after you have made an explanation that
      should satisfy any reasonable person, I still remain in my original way of
      thinking, I am not the woman who should be your wife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would see with my eyes if you were my wife,&rdquo; he said, and he believed
      that she would, so large an amount of confidence had he in his own power
      to dominate a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you have provided me with the strongest reason why I
      should never become your wife, Mr. Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not say that, Phyllis!&rdquo; he cried, in a low voice, almost a piteous
      voice. &ldquo;I must have you with me in this great work which I feel has been
      given me to accomplish. I am prepared to make any sacrifice for the cause
      which I have at heart&mdash;the cause to which I mean to devote the rest
      of my life; but you&mdash;you&mdash;I must have you with me, Phyllis.
      Don&rsquo;t give me an answer now. All I ask of you is to think over the whole
      matter from the standpoint of one who loves the truth, and who does not
      fear the result of those who are investigators. A few years ago the
      geologists were regarded as the enemies of the faith. Later the
      evolutionists were looked on with abhorrence. Had any clergyman ventured
      to assent to that doctrine which we now know to be the everlasting truth
      of the scheme of earthly life propounded by the Creator, he would have
      been compelled to leave the Church. I do not know what will happen to me,
      my Phyllis. No, no! do not say anything to me now. All that I ask of you
      is to think&mdash;think&mdash;think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is it&mdash;that is your modern scientific spirit!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You,
      and such as you, say &lsquo;think&mdash;think&mdash;think&rsquo; to us&mdash;to poor
      women and men who are asking for comfort, for protection against the evil
      of the world. You say &lsquo;think&mdash;think&mdash;think,&rsquo; when you should say
      pray&mdash;pray&mdash;pray.&rsquo; Where are you going to end? you have begun by
      taking from us our Bible. What do you propose to give us in exchange for
      it? No&mdash;no, don&rsquo;t answer me. I did not mean to enter into the
      question with you&mdash;to enter into any question with you. I have no
      right to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have every right, Phyllis. If I should cause offence to the least of
      the little ones of the flock with which I have been intrusted, it would be
      better that a millstone were hanged round my neck and that I were cast
      into the sea. You have a right to ask and it is laid on me to answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I decline to avail myself of the privilege; I will ask you nothing,
      except to say good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not say it, Phyllis, and I will not hear you say it. Three months
      ago you told me that you loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I fancied that I did, but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! you think that you have the power to cease loving at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice? You will find out your mistake, my child. In love there are no
      good-bys. I take your hand now, but not to say good-by; I feel that you
      are still mine&mdash;that you will be mine more than ever when you think&mdash;think&mdash;and
      pray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You ask me to pray?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pray&mdash;pray for me, child. I need the prayers of such as you, for I
      feel that my hour of deepest trial is drawing nigh. Do you fancy that I am
      the man to take back anything that I have written? Look at me, Phyllis; I
      tell you here that I will stand by everything that I have written.
      Whatever comes of it, the book remains. Even if I lose all that I have
      worked for,&mdash;even if I lose you,&mdash;I will still say &lsquo;the book
      remains.&rsquo; I am ready to suffer for it. I say in all humility that I
      believe God will give me grace to die for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had given him her hand. He was still holding it when he spoke his
      final sentence, looking, not into her face, but into a space beyond it.
      His eyes more than suggested the eyes of a martyr waiting undaunted for
      the lighting of the fagots. Suddenly he dropped her hand. He looked for a
      moment into her face. He saw that the tears were upon it. He turned and
      walked out of the room without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      No word came from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that he had left her at exactly the right moment. She was
      undoubtedly annoyed by the publication of the book; but that was because
      she had read some reviews of it, and was, girl-like, under the impression
      that the murmur of the reviewers was the mighty voice that echoes round
      the world. He felt that she would think differently when his real
      persecution began. He looked forward with great hope to the result of his
      real persecution. She would never hold out against that. If the bishop
      would only take action at once and attempt to deprive him of his
      pastorate, there was nothing that he might not look for.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he reflected that on the following Sunday the church would be
      crowded to the doors. She would see that. She would see the thousands of
      the fashionable women&mdash;he hoped even for men&mdash;who would fill
      every available seat, every available standing place in the church, and
      who would all be anxious to hear his defense. That would show her that the
      publication of this book had raised him far above the heads of the
      ordinary clergyman who droned away, Sunday after Sunday, in half empty
      churches to congregations that never became interested. Yes, for many
      Sundays St. Chad&rsquo;s would be crowded to the doors. And then he trusted that
      the bishop would take action against him, and in proportion to the
      severity of his persecution on the one hand would be his popularity on the
      other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this would, he felt, advance the cause which he had at heart; for he
      was thoroughly sincere in his belief that the views which he advocated in
      &ldquo;Revised Versions&rdquo; were calculated to place the Church on a firmer basis,
      and to cause it to appeal to those persons who, having been inculcated
      with the spirit of modern scientific inquiry, never entered a church
      porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been guilty of an empty boast when he had expressed to her his
      readiness to die for the principles which he had enunciated with
      considerable clearness in his book; but, at the same time, when he was
      walking down Piccadilly he could not avoid the feeling that if he were
      only subjected to a vigorous persecution&mdash;a high-class persecution,
      of course, with the bishop at the head of it, he would be almost certain
      to win back Phyllis. Her desertion of him was undoubtedly a blow to him;
      but he thought that, after all, it was not unnatural that such as girl as
      she should be somewhat frightened at the boldness of the book which he had
      published. He had seen the day, not so very long ago, when he would have
      been frightened at it himself. At any rate he felt sure that Phyllis would
      be able to differentiate between the case of the author of &ldquo;Revised
      Versions&rdquo; and the case of the mediocre clergyman who defied his bishop on
      a question of&mdash;what was the question?&mdash;something concerning the
      twirling of his thumbs from east to west, instead of from west to east;
      yes, or an equally trivial matter. He trusted that she was too
      discriminating a girl to bracket him with that wretched, shallow-minded
      person who endeavored to pose as a martyr, because he would not be
      permitted to do whatever he tried to insist on doing. Mr. Holland thought
      it had something to say to the twirling of his thumbs at a certain part of
      the service for the day, but if anyone had said that his memory was at
      fault&mdash;that the contumacious curate only wanted to make some gestures
      at the psychological, or, perhaps, the spiritual, moment, he would not
      have been surprised. He had always thought that curate a very silly
      person. He thanked his God that he was not such a man, and he thought that
      he might trust Phyllis to understand the difference between the position
      which he assumed and the posturing of the silly curate.
    </p>
    <p>
      His knowledge of her powers of discrimination was not at fault. Phyllis
      never for a moment thought of him as posturing. She did him more than
      justice. She regarded him as terribly in earnest; no man unless one who
      was terribly in earnest could have written that book&mdash;a book which
      she felt was bound to alienate from him all the people who had previously
      honored him and delighted to listen to his preaching. Someone had said in
      her hearing that the preaching of George Holland was, compared to the
      preaching of the average clergyman, as the electric light is to the gas&mdash;the
      gas of a street lamp. She had flushed with pleasure,&mdash;that had been
      six months ago,&mdash;when it first occurred to her that to be the wife of
      a distinguished clergyman, who was also a scholar, was the highest
      vocation to which a woman could aspire. She had told her father of this
      testimony to the ability of the rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s&mdash;pride had been
      in her voice and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man who said that was a true critic,&rdquo; her father had remarked.
      &ldquo;Electric light? Quite so. In the absence of sunlight the electric light
      does extremely well for the requirements of the average man and woman.
      Your critic said nothing about volts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was how her father became irritating to her occasionally&mdash;leading
      up to some phrase which he had in his collection of bric-a-brac. &ldquo;Volts!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she felt that the sincerity of George Holland would alienate from him
      all the people who had previously held him in high esteem. Although she
      was a daughter of Philistia, it had never occurred to her that there is
      such a thing as a <i>succes scandale</i>, and that the effect of such an
      incident in connection with the rector of a fashionable church rarely
      leads to his isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did George Holland more than justice, for she could not conceive his
      looking forward to a crowded and interested attendance at his church on
      the following Sunday and perhaps many successive Sundays. She could not
      conceive his thinking what effect the noticing of such an attendance would
      have upon her. To her, as to most girls, the heroic man is all heroic. The
      picture of the Duke of Marlborough taking a list of the linen to be sent
      to the wash while his troops were getting into position for a great battle
      is one from which they turn away. She could not think of George Holland&rsquo;s
      calculating upon the effect of a crowded church, with newspaper reporters
      scattered throughout the building, taking down every word that might fall
      from his lips. She regarded him as a man who had been compelled, by the
      insidious influence of what he called scientific thought, to write a
      shocking book; but one that he certainly believed was destined to effect a
      great reform in the world. Her eyes had filled with tears as he stood
      before her with the gleam of martyrdom in his eyes, and for an instant she
      felt a woman&rsquo;s impulse&mdash;that was a factor which George Holland had
      taken into consideration before he had spoken&mdash;to give both her hands
      to him and to promise to stand by his side in his hour of trial. But she
      thought of Ruth and restrained herself. Before he had reached the door she
      thought of him as the man from whom she had managed to escape before it
      was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered if any of those young women of the church, who had gone back
      to their butterfly garments on hearing that Mr. Holland had asked her to
      marry him, would hunt out the sober garments which they had discarded and
      wear them when they would hear that she was not going to marry Mr.
      Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rather thought that they would get new dresses and hats of the right
      degree of sobriety. Fashions change so quickly between February and May.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was the question of sleeves!
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyhow they would, she felt, regard themselves as having another chance.
      That was how they would put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only for an instant did she become thoughtful. Then she sprang to her feet
      from the sofa on which she had thrown herself when her tears were
      threatening, and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them have him&mdash;let them all have him&mdash;all&mdash;all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That would have been absurd.

      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      IF A GIRL REALLY LOVES A MAN SHE WILL MARRY HIM, EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD
      WRITE A BOOK.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis meant the half hour which would elapse before her tea was brought
      to her to be a very grateful space. She meant to dwell upon the
      achievement of her freedom, for the feeling that she was free was very
      sweet to her. The fetters that had bound her had been flung away, and she
      now only had a splendid sense of freedom. So sweet was this sense that she
      made up her mind that in future it would never do for her to run any such
      risk as that to which she had just subjected herself. How could she ever
      have been such a fool as to promise to marry George Holland? That was what
      she was asking herself as she lay back on the pillows of the French sofa,
      and listened to the soft sound of the carriage wheels of the callers at
      the other houses in the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a singular wish that was of hers&mdash;to become the wife of a
      clergyman! It seemed very singular to her just now. Just now she did not
      want to become the wife of anyone, and she hoped that no one would ask
      her. She did not want the worry of it. Ah, she would be very careful in
      the future: she would take very good care that the fact of other girls
      wanting to marry one particular man would not make her anxious to have him
      all to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before her resolutions on this very important point had been fully
      considered in all their bearings, her maid entered to ask if she was at
      home. The butler had sent a footman to her to make that inquiry, the fact
      being that her particular friend, Mrs. Linton, had called to see her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis jumped up, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I am home to Mrs. Linton. She will have tea with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to a glass to see if the tears which had been in her eyes&mdash;they
      had not fallen&mdash;had left any traces that the acuteness of Ella Linton
      might detect. The result of her observation was satisfactory; she would
      not even need to sit with her back to the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mrs. Linton was announced, and flowed into the arms of her friend
      Phyllis, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I knew that you would be at home to me, my beloved, even though
      you might be in the midst of one of those brilliant speeches which you
      write out for your father to deliver in the House and cause people to
      fancy that he is the wittiest man in place&mdash;so unlike that dreadful
      teetotal man who grins through the horse collar and thinks that people are
      imposed on. Now let me look at you, you lucky girl! You are a lucky girl,
      you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Phyllis, &ldquo;you have called on me. We shall have tea in a
      minute. How good of you to come to me the first day you arrived in town!
      How well you are looking, my Ella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So glad you think so,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t aged much during the eight
      months we have been apart. I have had a very good time on the whole, and
      so had Stephen, though he was with me for close upon a month, poor little
      man! But it is you, Phyllis, it is you who are the girl of the hour.
      Heavens! you were farsighted! Who could have imagined that he would become
      so famous all in a moment? I must confess that when you wrote to me that
      letter telling me of your engagement, and how happy you were, I was a
      little cross. I could not clearly see you the wife of a parson, even so
      presentable a parson as Mr. Holland. Oh, of course I wrote you the usual
      exuberant letter&mdash;what would be the good of doing anything else? But
      now that he has become famous&mdash;Oh, I want you to bring him with you
      to my first At Home&mdash;Tuesday week. It&rsquo;s very short notice, I know,
      but you must come, and bring him. You are both certain to be in great
      demand. Why do you shake your head that way? You need not say that you are
      engaged for Tuesday week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not say that I am engaged at all, in any sense,&rdquo; said Phyllis,
      with a very shallow laugh, at laugh that sounded like a ripple among
      pebbles; her usual laugh was like a ripple upon a silver sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In any sense&mdash;for Tuesday week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella raised her eyebrows to the extent of the eighth of an inch. She
      lowered them in a moment, however, for the tea was being brought in. It
      required two able-bodied men (in plush) to carry in a dainty little silver
      tray, with a little silver tea-pot of a pattern that silversmiths, for
      reasons which have never been fully explained, call &ldquo;Queen Anne.&rdquo; One of
      the men, however, devoted himself to the care of the hot cakes of various
      subtle types which were inclosed in silver covered dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the lowering of her eyebrows Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s voice lost its previous
      inflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been fortunate enough to hit upon something distinctly new in that
      way&rdquo;&mdash;she indicated the muffin dishes. &ldquo;A cake that may be eaten hot
      without removing one&rsquo;s gloves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a boon!&rdquo; cried Phyllis. &ldquo;You got it at Vienna, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. You will learn all about it when you come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The able-bodied men withdrew, and before the door was quite closed behind
      them, Ella was gazing at her friend, her face alight with inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now pray explain yourself,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Not engaged in any sense&mdash;those
      were your words. What do they mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take them literally, my Ella,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Literally? But you wrote to me that you had engaged yourself to marry Mr.
      Holland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now I tell you by word of mouth that I have disengaged myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens! You, I fancied, would be the last girl in the world to
      promise to marry a man and then back out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was what I myself fancied up till Monday last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how can you have changed your mind? Isn&rsquo;t it very unfortunate&mdash;just
      when the man has become famous?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could it be otherwise, Ella, when the man wrote so horrible a book as
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horrible? Is it horrible? I had no idea. I&rsquo;m no judge of what is horrible
      in theology, or metaphysics, or whatever it is. But I do profess to know
      when a man has made a hit, whether in theology or anything else; and I
      perceive quite clearly that your Mr. Holland&mdash;well, not your Mr.
      Holland, has made a distinct hit. What sort of face is that you&rsquo;re making
      at me? Oh, I see. It&rsquo;s the face of the orthodox at the mention of
      something not quite orthodox. Pshut! don&rsquo;t be a goose, Phyllis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t intend. Have I not told you that I&rsquo;m not going to marry Mr.
      Holland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is like one of the phrases which you give to your father, so that
      the people might think him clever. Orthodox! Who cares nowadays for what
      is dully orthodox? Who ever heard of a hero in orthodoxy nowadays? The
      thing is impossible. There may be, of course, thousands of orthodox
      heroes, but one never hears anything of them. The planets Jupiter and
      Saturn and Mercury and Mars and the rest of them come and go at their
      appointed seasons, and no one ever gives them a second thought, poor old
      respectable things! but the moment a comet appears in the sky everyone
      rushes out to gaze at it, and the newspapers deal with it from day to day,
      and the illustrated papers give its portrait. Nothing could be more
      unorthodox than your comet. Oh, Phyllis, my child, don&rsquo;t talk nowadays of
      orthodoxy or the other&mdash;what do they call it?&mdash;heterodoxy. Mr.
      Holland&rsquo;s name will be in everyone&rsquo;s mouth for the next year at least, and
      if his bishop or a friendly church warden prosecutes him, and the thing is
      worked up properly, he ought to be before the public for the next five
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not overstating the case, I assure you, my dear. A man was telling me
      about one Colenso&mdash;he was, so far as I could gather, a first-class
      man at algebra and heresy and things like that. He was Bishop of Zanzibar
      or Uganda or some place, and he wrote a book about Moses&mdash;showing
      that Moses couldn&rsquo;t have written something or other. Well, he took a bit
      of prosecuting, five or six years, I believe, and he didn&rsquo;t go nearly so
      far as Mr. Holland does in that book of his. All this time people talked
      about little else but Colenso, and his books made him a fortune. That was
      before our time, dear&mdash;when the newspapers weren&rsquo;t worked as they are
      now. Block printing has made more heroes than the longest campaign on
      record. Yes, Mr. Courtland said so two days ago. I think I&rsquo;ll try some
      more of that lovely cake: it&rsquo;s like warm ice, isn&rsquo;t it? Oh, you&rsquo;ll not be
      so foolish as to throw over your Mr. Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is already done,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad that you like the cake.
      It is very subtle. What a delightful idea&mdash;warm ice!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the cake. I want to hear more of this matter of Mr. Holland,&rdquo;
       said Ella. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me plainly that you threw over Mr. Holland
      because he wrote a book that will bring him fame and fortune?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thrown over Mr. Holland because he has written a book to make
      people have contempt for the Bible,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then all I can say is that you were never in love with the man,&rdquo; cried
      Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may say that if you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do say it. If a girl really loves a man, she will marry him even though
      he should write a book against Darwin. If a girl really loves a man she
      will stand by him all the closer when he is undergoing a course of
      honorable persecution, with his portrait in every paper that one picks
      up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say that is true enough,&rdquo; assented Phyllis. &ldquo;Perhaps I never did
      really love Mr. Holland. Perhaps I only fancied I cared for him because I
      saw that so many other girls&mdash;took to wearing chocolates and grays
      and kept their sleeves down just when sleeves were highest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it was only natural that you should wish to&mdash;well,
      colloquially, to wipe the eyes of the other girls. How many girls, I
      should like to know, begin to think of a man as a possible husband until
      they perceive that the thoughts of other girls are turned in his
      direction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, whatever I may have done long ago&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months ago. Whatever I may have done then, I know that I don&rsquo;t love
      him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure, my dear Phyllis. If there is one thing more than
      another about which a woman should never be positive, it is whether or not
      she loves a particular man. What mistakes they make! No, I&rsquo;ll never
      believe that you turned him adrift simply because he wrote something
      disparagingly about Solomon, or was it David? And I did so want you and
      him for my next day; I meant it to be such a <i>coup</i>, to have returned
      to town only a week and yet to have the most outrageously unorthodox
      parson at my house. Ah, that would indeed have been a <i>coup</i>! Never
      mind, I can at least have the beautiful girl who, though devoted to the
      unorthodox parson, threw him over on account of his unorthodoxy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are certain of me&mdash;that is, if you think I should&mdash;if
      it wouldn&rsquo;t seem a little&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense, Phyllis! Where have you been living for the past
      twenty-three years that you should get such a funny notion into your head?
      Do you think that girls nowadays absent themselves from felicity awhile
      when they find it necessary to become&mdash;well, disengaged&mdash;yes, or
      divorced, for that matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really can&rsquo;t recollect any case of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t. They don&rsquo;t exist. The proper thing for a women to do
      when she gets a divorce is to take a box at a theatre and give the
      audience a chance of recognizing her from her portraits that have already
      appeared in the illustrated papers. The block printing has done that too.
      There&rsquo;s not a theatre manager in London who wouldn&rsquo;t give his best box to
      a woman who has come straight from the divorce court. The managers
      recognize the fact that she is in the same line as themselves. But for
      you, my dear Phyllis&mdash;oh, you will never do him the injustice to keep
      your throwing over of him a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Injustice? Oh, Ella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say injustice. Good gracious, child! cannot you see that if it becomes
      known that the girl who had promised to marry him has broken off her
      engagement to him simply because he has written that book, the interest
      that attaches to him on account of his unorthodoxy will be immeasurably
      increased?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not do him the injustice of fancying for a moment that he would be
      gratified on this account. Whatever he may be, Ella, he is at least
      sincere and single-minded in his aims.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt of it, my only joy. But however sincere a man may be in
      his aims, he still cannot reasonably object to the distinction that is
      thrust upon him when he has done something out of the common. The men who
      make books know that that sort of thing pays. Someone told me the other
      day&mdash;I believe it was Herbert Courtland&mdash;that it is the men who
      write books embodying a great and noble aim who make the closest bargains
      with their publishers. I heard of a great and good clergyman the other day
      who wrote a Life of Christ, and then complained in the papers of his
      publishers having only given him a miserable percentage on the profits.
      That is how they talk nowadays; the profit resulting from the Life of
      Christ is to be measured in pounds, shillings, and pence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Holland is not a man of this stamp, Ella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure he is not. At the same time if he isn&rsquo;t prosecuted for
      heterodoxy no one will be more disappointed than Mr. Holland, unless,
      indeed, it be Mr. Holland&rsquo;s publisher. Who would begrudge the martyr his
      halo, dear? Even the most sincere and single-minded martyr has an eye on
      that halo. The halo of the up-to-date martyr is made up of afternoon teas
      provided by fair women, and full-page portraits in the illustrated
      papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all this leads to&mdash;what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It leads to&mdash;let me see&mdash;oh, yes, it leads to your appearance
      at my little gathering. Of course, you&rsquo;ll come. Believe me, you&rsquo;ll not
      feel the least uncomfortable. You will be The Girl who Sacrificed her Love
      for Conscience&rsquo; Sake. That&rsquo;s a good enough qualification for distinction
      on the part of any girl in these hard times. But I might have known long
      ago that you would play this part. That sweetly pathetic voice, with that
      firm mouth and those lovely soft gray eyes that would seem to a casual
      observer to neutralize the firmness of the mouth. Oh, yes, my Phyllis, you
      have undoubtedly <i>la physionomie du role</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>role</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>role</i> of the girl who is on the side of the Bible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am certainly on the side of the Bible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so am I. So I will look for you to be by my side on Tuesday week, and
      as often as you please in the meantime. By the way, you will probably meet
      Herbert Courtland at our house. He is the New Guinea man, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I know. You talk of wanting heroes in orthodoxy at your house,
      while you have Mr. Courtland, the New Guinea explorer, drinking his tea at
      your elbow? Oh, go away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will like him. We saw a good deal of him in Italy, and will
      probably see a good deal of him here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain to like him: you like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s what you said to the young women who put off their colors and
      took to sackcloth in the presence of Mr. Holland. Don&rsquo;t be too sure that
      you will like any man because other women like him. Now, I have, as usual,
      remained too long with you. I&rsquo;m greatly impressed with the situation of
      the moment. I don&rsquo;t say that I think you are wrong, mind you. Girls should
      always be on the side of the Bible. At any rate you have, I repeat, <i>la
      physionomie du role</i>, and you can&rsquo;t be far astray if you act up to it.
      Good-bye, my dearest.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE DEFENSE OF HOLLAND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ella Linton drove to a certain shop not far from Piccadilly,&mdash;the
      only shop where the arranging of feathers is treated as a science
      independent of the freaks of fashion,&mdash;and at the door she met a tall
      man with the complexion of mahogany but with fair hair and mustache.
      People nudged one another and whispered his name as they walked past him
      before standing at the shop window, pretending to admire the feathers, but
      in reality to glance furtively round at the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name that they whispered to one another after the nudge was Herbert
      Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his hat&mdash;it was a tall silk one, but no one who knew
      anything could avoid feeling that it should have been a solar toupee&mdash;when
      Mrs. Linton stepped from her victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you here!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Who on earth would expect to see you here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You asked me a question. I answered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed as they walked together to the door of the feather shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me that you have a very good opinion of yourself and a very
      bad one of me,&rdquo; she remarked, smiling up to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just where you make a mistake,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I did not think well of you I should not have ordered Parkinson to
      make you a fan of the tail of the meteor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bertie, you have done that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I not do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is the only one in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s just it. You are the only one in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed again, looking up to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll have a look at it, anyway,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went into the shop to see the tail feathers of that wonderful
      meteor-bird which Herbert Courtland had just brought back from New Guinea
      with him&mdash;the most glorious thing that nature had produced and a
      great explorer had risked his life to acquire, in order that Mrs. Linton
      might have a unique feathered fan.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time the Rev. George Holland met in the same thoroughfare
      his friend and patron, the Earl of Earlscourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the Lord Harry, you&rsquo;ve done for yourself now, my hearty!&rdquo; cried the
      earl. &ldquo;What the blazes do you mean by attacking the Word of God in that
      fashion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tommy,&rdquo; said the Rev. George Holland, smiling a patronizing smile at his
      patron, &ldquo;Tommy, my friend, if you take my advice you&rsquo;ll not meddle with
      what doesn&rsquo;t concern you. You&rsquo;re a peer; better leave the Word of God to
      me. I&rsquo;m not a peer, but a parson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not leave it with you; it isn&rsquo;t safe,&rdquo; said the peer. &ldquo;Anything more
      damnably atheistical than that book of yours I never read.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t read it, Thomas; you know you only read a screeching
      review of it, and you didn&rsquo;t even read that through,&rdquo; said the parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that?&rdquo; asked the patron. &ldquo;Well, at any rate I read what you
      said about Ruth. It was quite scandalous! Ruth! Good Lord! what character
      is safe nowadays? One of the loveliest of the women of the Bible&mdash;my
      wife says so. She knows all about them. And the best painters in the world
      have shown her standing among the field of oats. By the Lord, sir, it&rsquo;s
      sheer blasphemy! and worse than that, it&rsquo;s making people&mdash;good,
      religious people, mind, not the ruck&mdash;it&rsquo;s making them ask why the
      blazes I gave you the living. It&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for you, Tommy&mdash;very sorry. I&rsquo;m also sorry for your good
      religious people, and particularly sorry for the phraseology of their
      earnest inquiries on what I am sure is a matter of life and death to them&mdash;spiritually.
      That&rsquo;s my last word, Thomas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you were doing so well at the Joss-house, too.&rdquo; Lord Earlscourt was
      shaking his head sorrowfully, as he spoke. &ldquo;We were all getting on so
      comfortably. That was what people said to me&mdash;they said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, I&rsquo;m a parson, therefore I&rsquo;m not particular; but I can&rsquo;t stand
      the way your good religious people express themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s so d&mdash;&mdash; pleasant to get hold of a parson who
      can be trusted in the pulpit&mdash;sermons with a good healthy moral tone,
      and so forth. You might bring your youngest daughter to St. Chad&rsquo;s in the
      certainty that she would hear nothing that would make her ask
      uncomfortable questions when she got home.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a fact, they said that;
      and now you go and spoil all. The bishop will have a word to say to you
      some of these days, my lad. He ran away to the Continent, they tell me,
      when your book was published, and it&rsquo;s perfectly well known that he never
      runs away unless things look serious. When the bishop is serious, those
      that can&rsquo;t swim had best take to the boats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you for a seat in your yacht, Tommy. Meantime kindest regards to
      her ladyship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! by the way, it&rsquo;s not true, is it, that the girl has thrown you over
      on account of the book?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For an instant there came a little flush to the face of the Rev. George
      Holland; then he shifted his umbrella from one hand to the other, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean Phyllis, all I can say in reply is that she is the best and
      the truest girl alive at present. I&rsquo;ve an engagement at a quarter-past
      six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-by. It was my missus who said that the girl would throw you
      over on account of that book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honestly speaking, George, old man, I think you&rsquo;ve made a mistake this
      time. People don&rsquo;t mind much about Jacob and Jonah and Jeremiah and the
      whole job lot of Sheenies; but they do mind about Ruth. Hang it all man!
      she was a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! so was Jezebel, and yet&mdash;ah! good-by. I&rsquo;ll be late for my
      appointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See you on Sunday,&rdquo; said the earl, with a broadish smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      So did the largest congregation that had ever assembled within the
      venerable walls of St. Chad&rsquo;s. They heard him also, and so did the dozen
      reporters of the morning papers who were present&mdash;some to describe,
      with the subtle facetiousness of the newspaper reporter, the amusing
      occurrences incidental to the church service of the day, and others to
      take down his sermon to the extent of half a column to be headed &ldquo;The Rev.
      George Holland Defends Himself.&rdquo; One reporter, however, earned an increase
      in his salary by making his headline, &ldquo;The Defense of Holland.&rdquo; It was
      supposed that casual readers would fancy that the kingdom of Holland had
      been repelling an invader, and would not find out their mistake until they
      had read half through the sermon.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Holland had not been mistaken when he had assumed that his
      appearance in the church and his sermon this day would attract a large
      amount of attention. As a matter of fact the building was crowded with
      notable persons: Cabinet ministers (2), judges of the superior courts (4),
      company promoters (47), actors and actresses (3), music hall and variety
      artists (22), Royal Academician (1). Literature was represented by a lady
      who had written a high-church novel, and fashion by the publisher who had
      produced it. Science appeared in the person of a professional
      thought-reader (female). These were all strangers to St. Chad&rsquo;s, though
      some of them could follow the service quite easily. The habitues of the
      church included several peers, the members of a foreign embassy, a few
      outside brokers, quite a number of retired officers of both services, and
      some Members of Parliament and the London County Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the chaplains of the bishop occupied a seat in the aisle; according
      to the facetious newspaper he held a watching brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rector was, of course, oblivious of his brilliant entourage. He could
      not even tell if Phyllis or her father were present. (As a matter of fact
      both were in their accustomed seats in their own pew.) He, as usual, took
      but a small part in the ritual&mdash;as Lord Earlscourt once remarked,
      George Holland wasn&rsquo;t such a fool as to keep a dog and do the barking
      himself. (It has already been stated that he had a couple of excellent
      curates.) But the sermon was preached by himself, as indeed it usually was
      after the morning service.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the most brilliant of all his efforts. He took as his text the
      words, &ldquo;All Scripture is given by inspiration and is profitable,&rdquo; and he
      had no difficulty in showing how vast was the profit to be derived from a
      consideration of every portion of the sacred volume, it appeared to him,
      than the account given of the early history of the Hebrew race. That
      account appealed as an object lesson to all nations on the face of the
      earth. It allowed every people to see the course which the children of
      Israel had pursued at various periods of their existence and to profit by
      such observation. The Hebrews were a terrible example to all the world. If
      they were slaves when in the land of Egypt, that was their own fault.
      Milton had magnificently expressed the origin of slavery:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He that hath light within his own clear breast May walk i&rsquo; the noontide
      and enjoy bright day, But he that hides dark deeds and foul thoughts. . .
      . Himself is his own dungeon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bondage of Egypt was, he believed, self-imposed. There is no account
      available, he said, of the enslavement of the Children of Israel by the
      Egyptians, but a careful consideration of the history of various peoples
      shows beyond the possibility of a mistake being made, that only those
      become enslaved who are best fitted for enslavement. A king arose that
      knew not Joseph&mdash;a king who could not believe that at any time there
      was belonging to that race of strangers a man of supreme intelligence. The
      Israelites bowed their heads to the yoke of the superior race, the
      Egyptians, and took their rightful place as slaves. After many days a man
      of extraordinary intelligence appeared in the person of Moses. A patriot
      of patriots, he gave the race their God&mdash;they seemed to have lived in
      a perfectly Godless condition in Egypt; and their theology had to be
      constructed for them by their leader, as well as their laws: the laws for
      the desert wanderers, and a decalogue for all humanity. He was equal to
      any emergency, and he had no scruples. He almost succeeded in making a
      great nation out of a horde of superstitious robbers. Had he succeeded the
      record would have thrown civilization back a thousand years. Happy it was
      for the world that the triumph of crime was brief. The cement of bloodshed
      that kept the kingdom of Israel together for a time soon dissolved.
      Captivity followed captivity. For a thousand years no improvement whatever
      took place in the condition of the people&mdash;they had no arts; they
      lived in mud huts at a period when architecture reached a higher level
      than it had ever attained to previously. When the patriot prophets arose,
      endeavoring to reform them with words of fire&mdash;the sacred fire of
      truth&mdash;they killed them. One chance remained to them. They were
      offered a religion that would have purified them, in place of the
      superstition that had demoralized them, and they cried with one voice, as
      everyone who had known their history and their social characteristics knew
      they would cry, &ldquo;Not this Man, but Barabbas.&rdquo; That was from the earliest
      period in the history of the race the watchword of the Hebrews. Not the
      man, but the robber. All that is good and noble and true in manhood&mdash;the
      mercy, the compassion, the self-sacrifice that are comprised in true
      manhood&mdash;they cast beneath their feet, they spat upon, they
      crucified; but all of the Barabbas in man they embraced. Thus are they
      become a hissing in the earth, and properly so; for those who hiss at the
      spirit which has always animated Judaism show that they abhor a thing that
      is abhorrent. &ldquo;All Scripture is profitable,&rdquo; continued the preacher, &ldquo;and
      practically all that is referred to in the text is an indictment of
      Judaism. The more earnestly we hold to this truth the greater will be the
      profit accruing to us from a consideration of the Scripture. But what more
      terrible indictment of the Hebrew systems could we have than that which is
      afforded us in the record that the father of the race had twelve sons? He
      had. But where are ten of them now? Swept out of existence without leaving
      a single record of their destruction even to their two surviving
      brethren.&rdquo; He concluded his sermon by stating that he hoped it would be
      clearly understood that he recognized the fact that in England those
      members of the Hebrew community who had adopted the methods, the
      principles, the truths of Christianity even though they still maintained
      their ancient form of worship in their synagogues, were on a line with
      civilization. They searched their scriptures and these scriptures had been
      profitable to them, inasmuch as they had been taught by those scriptures
      how impossible it was for that form of superstition known as Judaism to be
      the guide for any people on the face of the earth.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT EVENTUALLY MARRY AN INFIDEL.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some of the congregation were greatly disappointed. They had expected a
      brilliant and startling attack upon some other Bible personages who had
      hitherto been looked on with respect and admiration. But the sermon had
      only attacked the Jewish system as a whole, and everyone knows that there
      is nothing piquant in an attack, however eloquent it may be, upon a
      religious system in the abstract. One might as well find entertainment in
      an attack upon the Magnetic Pole or a denunciation of the Precession of
      the Equinoxes. No one cared, they said, anything more about the failure of
      the laws of Moses than one did about such abstractions as the Earth&rsquo;s
      Axis, or the Great Glacial Epoch. It was quite different when the
      characters of well-known individuals were subjected to an assault. People
      could listen for hours to an attack upon celebrated persons. If Mr.
      Holland&rsquo;s book had only dealt with the characteristics of the religion of
      the Jews, it would never have attracted attention, these critics said. It
      had called for notice simply because of its trenchant remarks in regard to
      some of those Bible celebrities who, it was generally understood, were
      considered worthy of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why could Mr. Holland not have followed up the course indicated in his
      book by showing up some of the other persons in the Bible? it was asked.
      There were quite a number of characters in the Bible who were regarded as
      estimable. Why could he not then have followed up his original scheme of
      &ldquo;showing them up?&rdquo;&mdash;that was the phrase of the critics. There was
      Solomon, for instance. He was usually regarded as a person of high
      intellectual gifts; but there was surely a good deal in his career which
      was susceptible of piquant treatment. And then someone said that Noah
      should have a chapter all to himself, also Lot; and what about the spies
      who had entered Jericho? Could the imagination not suggest the story which
      they had told to their wives on their return to the camp, relative to the
      house in which they had passed all their spare time? They supposed that
      Jericho was the Paris of the high class Jews of those days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the conversation of these critics drifted on to the Paris of to-day,
      and the sermon and its lessons were forgotten as easily as is an ordinary
      sermon. But all the same it was plain that the clergyman had fallen short
      of what was expected of him upon this occasion. His book had gone far, and
      it was felt that he should have gone one better than his book, so to
      speak. Instead of that his sermon had been one to which scarcely any
      exception could be taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the bishop&rsquo;s chaplain, who had watched at intervals of praying, came
      to the conclusion that the rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s was a good deal cleverer
      than the majority of youngish clergymen who endeavor to qualify for
      prosecution. It may be unorthodox to cross one&rsquo;s arms with the regularity
      of clockwork on coming to certain words in the service, and young
      clergymen had been prosecuted for less; but it was not unorthodox to speak
      evil of the Jews&mdash;for did not the Church pray for the Jews daily? and
      can anyone insult a man more than by praying for him&mdash;unless, of
      course, he is a king, in which case it is understood that no insult is
      intended?
    </p>
    <p>
      The bishop&rsquo;s chaplain prepared a report of the sermon for his lordship,
      pointing out its general harmony, broadly speaking, with the tenets of the
      Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton also seemed to perceive a sort of cleverness in the sermon.
      There was nothing in it that was calculated to shock even the most
      susceptible hearer. Indeed, it seemed to Mr. Ayrton that there was a good
      deal in it that was calculated to soothe the nerves of those who had been
      shocked by the book. He said something to this effect to his daughter as
      they walked homeward. He was rather anxious to find out what chance George
      Holland had of being restored to his daughter&rsquo;s favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Phyllis was firm in her condemnation of the methods of Mr. Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He attacks the Jews as a race in order to ridicule the statement in the
      Bible that they were God&rsquo;s chosen people, and they were, you know, papa,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They took so much for granted themselves, at any rate,&rdquo; said her father,
      with some show of acquiescence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they were, and they are to be restored to their own land,&rdquo; said
      Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they, my dear? I should like to see the prospectus of that
      enterprise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mocking, papa. They are to be restored; it says so in the Bible
      quite clearly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not mocking, Phyllis. If gold is discovered in Palestine, the Jews
      may go there in some numbers; but, take my word for it, they won&rsquo;t go
      otherwise. They couldn&rsquo;t live in their own land, assuming that it is their
      own, which is going pretty far. Palestine wouldn&rsquo;t support all the Jews
      alive at present; it&rsquo;s a wretched country&mdash;I know it well. Besides,
      they don&rsquo;t want to return to it, and furthermore, we couldn&rsquo;t spare them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in the Bible, and I have faith,&rdquo; said Phyllis firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;I hope you may always hold to both. I
      think that those girls who expect to be regarded as advanced, because they
      scoff at the Bible and at faith, are quite horrid. I also hope that you
      will not eventually marry an infidel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be impossible,&rdquo; said Phyllis firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it?&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;There is a stronger influence at work in
      most of us, at times, than religion. I wonder if it will make a victim of
      you, my child, though you did send George Holland about his business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know what you mean,&rdquo; said Phyllis, with only the slightest
      possible flush.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she did not know what he meant until six months had passed; but then
      she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing that she did not know what he meant, her father thanked Heaven that
      Heaven had given him a daughter who was unlike other daughters. He prayed
      that she might never become like other daughters. He thought that it would
      be good for his daughter to remain without experience of those
      overwhelming passions which make up the life of a woman and a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis went out a good deal during the week, and everywhere she found
      herself looked at with interest; sometimes she found herself being
      examined through a <i>pince-nez</i> as if she were a curious specimen, and
      a woman or two smiled derisively at her. She did not know what was meant
      by their curiosity&mdash;their derision&mdash;until one day an old lady
      named Mrs. Haddon went up to her and kissed her, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I made up my mind that I would kiss you, my dear, the first chance I had.
      God bless you, my child! You have given your testimony as a woman should,
      in these days of scoffing at the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Testimony?&rdquo; said Phyllis, quite puzzled. Had not her father felt a thrill
      of gratitude on reflecting that she had none of the qualities of the prig
      about her? &ldquo;Testimony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have testified to the truth, Miss Ayrton, and you shall have your
      reward. You have shown that the truth is more to you than&mdash;than love&mdash;the
      love of man&mdash;all that women hold sweet in life. You are right Miss
      Ayrton; and all true women must love and respect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis turned a very brilliant color, and kept her eyes fixed on the
      parquet pattern of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dear old lady said a good deal more to her, all in praise of her act
      of having given Mr. Holland his <i>conge</i> on account of his having
      written that shockingly unorthodox book.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of the week Phyllis Ayrton was looked on as quite as much a
      heroine for having given Mr. Holland his <i>conge</i>, as Mr. Holland was
      a hero for having braved the bishop in writing the book. She wore her
      laurels meekly, though she had been rather embarrassed when a ray of
      intelligence appeared among the dark sayings of the dear old lady. She
      could not help wondering how all the world had become possessed of the
      knowledge that she had said good-by to her lover. She considered if it
      were possible that Mr. Holland had spread abroad the account of her
      ill-treatment of him&mdash;he would naturally allude to it as
      ill-treatment. The quick judgment of Ella Linton had enabled her to
      perceive how valuable to Mr. Holland was the incident of his rejection by
      Phyllis. As a beginning of his persecution, its importance could scarcely
      be overestimated. But it did not take Phyllis long to reassure herself on
      this matter. It was, of course, Ella who had given the incident publicity.
      She had done so for two reasons: first, in order that her little afternoon
      At Home might have additional luster attached to it by the presence of a
      young woman who had, in these days of a marriage market overstocked with
      young women (and old women, for that matter), thrown over an eligible man
      for conscience&rsquo; sake; and secondly, in order that her At Home might have
      additional luster attached to it from the presence of the man who allowed
      himself to be thrown over by a delightful girl rather than refrain from
      publishing what he believed to be the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Linton achieved both the objects which, as a good hostess, she had in
      view. Mr. Holland put in an appearance in one of Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s big drawing
      rooms, and so did Phyllis Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone admitted that only a woman of the social capacity&mdash;some
      people called it genius&mdash;of Mrs. Linton could accomplish such a feat
      as the bringing into the same room two persons who had given unmistakable
      evidence of possessing a conscience apiece&mdash;the woman who had
      sacrificed the man for conscience&rsquo; sake, and the man who had sacrificed
      the woman under the same influence. It was a social triumph, beyond doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      People talked in whispers of conscience, the advantages and the
      disadvantages of its possession, and the consensus of opinion was of its
      being quite appropriate in regard to a clergyman, and that it was not
      altogether out of place on the part of a spinster, provided that she had
      counteracting virtues; but, on the whole, it was perhaps wiser to leave
      the conscience with the Nonconformists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis did not see George Holland until she had got halfway up the first
      of Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s rooms. She did not hear her friend Ella say to someone,
      in a low voice of apprehension:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, keep them apart! They are just the sort of people to
      greet each other quite cordially; and if they do, no one here will believe
      that their engagement is off. People here don&rsquo;t understand how a delicate
      conscience works.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was what Ella murmured to a man who had been invited in order that he
      might make himself generally useful. She gave him his instructions too
      late, however. Before she had quite completed her greeting of Phyllis, Mr.
      Holland was beside them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not forced himself forward with any measure of persistency; no one
      seemed to notice any movement on his part until he had shaken hands with
      Phyllis, and was chatting with her and Mrs. Linton quite pleasantly&mdash;much
      too pleasantly for a man with a conscience, someone said later in the
      afternoon; but that was someone who wanted to talk to Phyllis himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      People watched her when she suffered herself to be gradually withdrawn
      from the center of the room to a seat that chanced to be vacant, just
      behind the open door of the conservatory. Could it be possible, they asked
      one another, that she had indeed given his dismissal to Mr. Holland the
      previous week? Why, they were chatting together as pleasantly as they had
      ever chatted. Had not the people who talked so glibly of conscience and
      its mysterious operations spoken a little too soon? Or had the quarrel
      been patched up? If so, which of the two had got rid of the conscience
      that had brought about the original rupture?
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions were answered at divers places by divers persons, all the
      time that George Holland and Phyllis Ayrton remained side by side at the
      entrance to the conservatory, at the further end of which a vocal
      quartette party sang delightfully&mdash;delightfully; sufficiently loud to
      enable all the guests who wanted to talk to do so without inconvenience,
      and at the same time not so loud as to become obtrusive. It is so seldom
      that a quartette party manage to hit this happy medium, people said. They
      generally sing as if they fancy that people come together to hear them,
      not remembering that the legitimate object of music at an At Home is to
      act as an accompaniment to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Phyllis was leaving the house half an hour later, a man was just
      entering the first drawing room&mdash;a man with a face burnt to the color
      of an old mezzotint.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her for a moment as he passed her, for her face had suddenly
      lighted up, as such a face as hers does upon occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man could scarcely fail to perceive that she knew his name was Herbert
      Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then he was accustomed to be recognized by women as well as men in
      every part of Europe, since he had returned from New Guinea with the tail
      feathers of the meteor-bird, which were now being made into a fan for Mrs.
      Linton.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MY FATHER HAS HIS IDEAS ON WHAT&rsquo;S CALLED REALISM.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The last rumble of applause had died away at the Parthenon Theater, but
      the audience were leaving very slowly; they wished to linger as long as
      possible within the atmosphere of the building; though, like the
      atmosphere of many sacred places, that of the Parthenon was, just at that
      time, a trifle unsavory. The first performance of the drama of
      &ldquo;Cagliostro&rdquo; had just taken place, and, as the first nights at the
      Parthenon are invariably regarded as the most exclusive functions of the
      year, the stalls and boxes had been crowded. And the distinction which in
      Mayfair and Belgravia attaches to those who have been in the boxes and
      stalls on Parthenon first night is not greater than that which, in
      Bloomsbury and Camden Town, accrues to those who have occupied places&mdash;not
      necessarily seats&mdash;in the other parts of the house. It is understood,
      too, that the good will of Bloomsbury and Camden Town is much more
      valuable to a play than the best wishes of Mayfair and Belgravia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gracious manager had made his customary speech of thanks,&mdash;for
      everything produced at the Parthenon was a success,&mdash;and while the
      general audience were moving away very reluctantly, some distinguished men
      and women followed the guidance of a strong Irish brogue as a flock
      follows a bell-wether, through a door that led to the stage. Here the
      great actor and the ever-charming lady who divided with him the affections
      of West as well as East, received their guests&rsquo; congratulations in such a
      way as made the guests feel that the success was wholly due to their good
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Linton, who was a personage in society,&mdash;her husband had found a
      gold mine (with the assistance of Herbert Courtland) and she had herself
      written a book of travels which did not sell,&mdash;had brought Phyllis
      with her party to the theater, and they had gone on the stage with the
      other notabilities, at the conclusion of the performance. George Holland,
      having become as great a celebrity as the best of them during that
      previous fortnight, had naturally received a stall and an invitation to
      the stage at the conclusion of the performance. He had not been of Mrs.
      Linton&rsquo;s party, but he lay in wait for that party as they emerged from
      their box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another man also lay in wait for them, and people&mdash;outsiders&mdash;nudged
      one another in the theater as the passers down Piccadilly had nudged one
      another, whispering his name, Herbert Courtland. Others&mdash;they were
      not quite such outsiders&mdash;nudged one another when Mrs. Linton laid
      down her new feather fan on the ledge of the box. It was possibly the
      loveliest thing that existed in the world at that moment. No artist had
      ever dreamed of so wonderful a scheme of color&mdash;such miracles of
      color&mdash;combinations in every feather from the quill to the
      spider-web-like fluffs at the tips, each of which shone not like gold but
      like glass. It was well worth all the nudging that it called forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Mrs. Linton had picked it up from the ledge, beginning to
      oscillate it in front of her fair face, the nudging ceased. People looked
      at the thing with eyes wide with astonishment, but with lips mute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A more satisfactory evening she had never spent, Mrs. Linton felt; and now
      the fan was hanging down among the brocaded flowers of her dress, making
      them look tawdry as she left the box, and noticed how at least two men
      were lying in wait for her party. There was, however, a frankness in
      Herbert Courtland&rsquo;s strategy which George Holland&rsquo;s did not possess. Mr.
      Courtland was looking directly at her; Mr. Holland was pretending to be
      engrossed in conversation with a man in one of the end stalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted a finger and Courtland went to her side. The difficulties of
      the jungle along the banks of the Fly River were trifling compared with
      the obstacles he had to overcome in obeying her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had no idea that you would be here,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where else should I be?&rdquo; he said, in so low a tone as to be heard only by
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are so glad,&rdquo; said Mrs. Linton. &ldquo;I want to present you to my dearest
      friend, Phyllis Ayrton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. She has never met a man. She will to-night,&rdquo; said Ella. Then she
      turned to Phyllis, who was walking beside Lord Earlscourt. &ldquo;Come here,
      Phyllis,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you are the only person in London who doesn&rsquo;t yet
      know Mr. Herbert Courtland. This is Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that Phyllis went upon the stage of the Parthenon by the side
      of Herbert Courtland instead of by the side of George Holland; and the
      little laugh that Mrs. Linton gave was due to her careful observation of
      the latter&rsquo;s face when he perceived, as he did in spite of the engrossing
      nature of his conversation with his friend in the end stall, how his
      designs had been defeated by her tactics. She would not have minded having
      Herbert Courtland with her for the hour they might remain at the theater,
      but she had made up her mind that it was not to Phyllis&rsquo; advantage that
      Mr. Holland should continue by her side in public after she had given him
      his dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      She also perceived, with even greater gratification, that Herbert
      Courtland was looking nearly as dissatisfied with the result of her
      tactics as George Holland. If he had looked pleased at being by the side
      of Phyllis when he expected to be with her&mdash;Ella&mdash;what would
      life be worth to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he was dissatisfied at being with Phyllis instead of Mrs. Linton,
      he did not consider that any reason for neglecting the former. He wondered
      if she had any choice in sandwiches&mdash;of course she had in champagne.
      His curiosity was satisfied, and Phyllis was amply provided for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s dearest friend,&rdquo; he remarked casually, as they
      leaned up against the profile of the Church scene in &ldquo;Cagliostro,&rdquo; for
      they were standing in the &ldquo;wings&rdquo;&mdash;to be exact&mdash;on the O. P.
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is my dearest friend, at any rate,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were not at school together. She is four or five years older than
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only three. When she got married she seemed to me to be almost venerable.
      Three years seemed a long time then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now you fancy that you have formed a right idea of what is meant by
      three years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a better idea, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are still a good way off it. But if you have formed a right estimate
      of a woman&rsquo;s friendship&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s still something, you mean to say? But why did you stop short, Mr.
      Courtland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis was looking up to his face with a smile of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid that you might think I was on the way to preach a sermon on
      the text of woman&rsquo;s friendship. I pulled myself up just in time. I&rsquo;m glad
      that I didn&rsquo;t frighten you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; you didn&rsquo;t frighten me, Mr. Courtland. I was only wondering how
      you would go on&mdash;whether you would treat the topic sentimentally or
      cynically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what conclusion did you come to on the subject?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that you are a brave man&mdash;perhaps the bravest man alive. You
      would, I think, have treated the question seriously&mdash;feelingly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The adoption of that course implies courage certainly. All the men of
      sentimentality&mdash;which is something quite different from sentiment,
      mind you&mdash;have taken to writing melodrama and penny novelettes. You
      didn&rsquo;t hear much sentimentality on this stage to-night, or any other
      night, for that matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it would have sounded unreal. A Parthenon audience would resent what
      they believed to be a false note in art; and a Parthenon audience is
      supposed to be the concentration of the spirit of the period in thought
      and art; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m half a savage. But I like to think the best of a
      Parthenon audience; you and I formed part of that concentration to-night&mdash;yes,
      I like to think the best of it. I suppose we know&mdash;we, the Parthenon
      audience, I mean&mdash;what our feelings are on the art of acting&mdash;the
      art of play-writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like to have to define my feelings at a moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must make a beginning, and then work up gradually to the definition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For instance&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for instance, there&rsquo;s something that people call realism nowadays.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father has his ideas on what&rsquo;s called realism,&rdquo; Phyllis laughed.
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Realism in painting is the ideal with a smudge.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear what you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He also laughed sympathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I only venture to think that realism is the opposite to reality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, so far as I can gather, your definition is not wanting in breadth&mdash;no,
      nor in accuracy. Sentimentality is the opposite to sentiment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a point on which we agreed a moment ago. My father says that
      sentiment is a strong man&rsquo;s concealment of what he feels, while
      sentimentality is a weak man&rsquo;s expression of what he doesn&rsquo;t feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Parthenon audience&mdash;you and I&mdash;laugh at the latter&mdash;that
      is, because we have practiced some form of athletics. The bicycle has
      given its <i>coup de grace</i> to sentimentality. That man over there with
      the head and face like a lion&rsquo;s, and that woman whose face is nature
      illuminated, have long ago recognized the shallowness of sentimentality&mdash;the
      depths of sentiment. We could not imagine either of them striking a false
      note. They have been the teachers of this generation&mdash;the generation
      to which you belong. Great Heavens! to think that for so many years human
      passion should be banished from art, though every line of Shakspere is
      tremulous with passion! Why, the word was absolutely banished; it was
      regarded as impure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that&mdash;I was at a boarding school. The preceptresses regarded
      as impure everything that is human.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whereas, just the opposite is the case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say that, Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could scarcely say it. I am only beginning to think it, and I have
      lived among savages for years. That man with the lion&rsquo;s face has not
      feared to deal with passion. All actors who have lived since Garrick have
      never gone further than to illustrate passion in the hands of a man; but
      that lion-man, whose stage we are now standing on, shows us not the
      passion in the hands of a man, but the man in the hands of the passion.
      The man who tears the passion to tatters is the robustious periwig-pated
      fellow; the actor, who shows us the man torn in tatters by the passion, is
      the supreme artist. I am no authority on modern literature; but I must
      confess that I was astonished at the change that a few years have brought
      about. I was in a proper position for noticing it, having been practically
      without books for two years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a change for the better, do you think, Mr. Courtland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel certain that it is for the better. I refer, of course, only to the
      books of those real investigators&mdash;real artists. I refer to the
      fountain-heads, not to the hydrants laid down by the water companies at
      the end of about ten miles of foul piping. I don&rsquo;t like the product of the
      hydrants. I like the springs, and, however natural they may be, I don&rsquo;t
      find anything impure in them. Why I love the Bible is because it is so
      very modern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think, then, that it is yet obsolete, Mr. Courtland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No book that deals so truly with men and women can ever be obsolete, the
      fact being that men and women are the same to-day as they were ten
      thousand years ago, perhaps ten million years ago, though I&rsquo;m not quite so
      sure of that. The Bible, and Shakspere, and Rofudingding, a New Guinea
      poet, who ate men for his dinner when he had a chance, and, when he had
      finished, sang lyrics that stir the hearts of all his fellow-islanders to
      this day,&mdash;he lived a hundred years ago,&mdash;dealt with men and
      women; that is why all are as impressive to-day as they were when
      originally composed. Men and women like reading about men and women, and
      it is becoming understood, nowadays, that the truth about men and women
      can never be contemptible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but how do we know that it is the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Therein the metaphysician must minister to himself. I cannot suggest to
      you any test of the truth, if you have none with you. Everyone capable of
      pronouncing a judgment on any matter must feel how truthfully the
      personages in the Bible have been drawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the Bible is the Word of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe that it is, most certainly. That profound wisdom; that
      toleration of the weaknesses of men; that sympathy with men, who cannot
      fathom the mysteries of life, and the struggle for life of all things that
      love life; that spirit I call God, and I don&rsquo;t think that a better name
      has been found for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&mdash;for <i>it</i>? You think of God as merely a force of nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just the contrary. God is the spirit that lives in warfare with nature.
      Great Heavens! isn&rsquo;t that the truth of which the whole Bible is the
      allegory? Nature and nature&rsquo;s laws constitute the Devil. God is the
      opposing Force. It is a law of nature to kill off the weak, to crush that
      which has fallen in the struggle. It is God who helps the weak&mdash;who
      helps the feeble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But merely a force?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have no private opinion on that part of the question. I am not like
      that modern philosopher who fancied he had solved the whole problem by
      spelling God with a small g. But don&rsquo;t you think that we have gone quite
      far enough in our exchange of confidence for a first meeting? You are what
      the Italians call <i>simpatica</i>&mdash;that is, more than merely
      sympathetic. You look at one, and lead one on to confide in you as one
      does not confide in most girls. You are a thoroughly dangerous young
      woman, Miss Ayrton, though you are Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s dearest friend. By the
      way, can you make her confide in you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There seemed to be a measure of curiosity, not to say anxiety, in the tone
      of this inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she makes me confide in her. I wonder if that is just the same
      thing,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not exactly the same thing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the proper course
      for dearest friends to adopt toward each other. For the maintenance of a
      firm friendship between any two persons, only one should confide; the
      other should be strictly the confidante. By the way, I wonder what is the
      average duration of the dearest friendship between two women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it have any limits?&rdquo; said Phyllis gravely. &ldquo;What is the
      duration of the friendship between two men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It mostly depends on when the woman makes her appearance,&rdquo; said he, with
      a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! So that&mdash;&mdash;Ah, never mind. Ella was my dearest friend
      before Mr. Linton put in an appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he was mine before she put in an appearance,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you see, is my contention borne out,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You are the one
      who confides; she is the one who receives the confidences, and respects
      them, I&rsquo;m sure. I hope that you will do the same, Miss Ayrton. Don&rsquo;t let
      anyone know that I confided in you all that I think on the subject of the
      old Adam and the new Eve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one except Ella Linton, and you know that I can keep nothing from her
      if we are to remain dearest friends. Perhaps she knows already the limits
      of your belief, Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does&mdash;she does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Ella Linton came up with Lord Earlscourt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Mr. Courtland been telling you all about the bird of paradise?&rdquo; she
      asked of Phyllis, while she waved the tail feathers of the loveliest of
      the birds of paradise before her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The bird?&mdash;not the <i>bird</i>,&rdquo; laughed Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the topic was paradise?&rdquo; Ella joined in the laugh&mdash;yes, to some
      extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked of Adam&mdash;the old one of that name,&rdquo; said Mr. Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Eve&mdash;the new one of that name,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theology is in the air!&rdquo; cried Ella. &ldquo;Even the stage of a theater is not
      free from the taint. It must be the case of Mr. Holland. Where is Mr.
      Holland, by the way, Lord Earlscourt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him for some time. He must have gone away. I&rsquo;m not Mr.
      Holland&rsquo;s keeper, thank Heaven!&rdquo; said Lord Earlscourt, with heartfelt
      devoutness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you know that everyone holds you accountable for what he has done!&rdquo;
       said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s just where everyone makes a mistake,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Great Lord!
      is it your idea of British justice to persecute the wrong man? Why doesn&rsquo;t
      the bishop do his duty? What do we pay him for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t abandon our charity at the call of theology,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theology&mdash;represented by Lord Earlscourt,&rdquo; said Mr. Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ve been abused during the past fortnight, indeed you
      don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; moaned Lord Earlscourt. &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s my own wife, she abused me
      like a cab-driver because George Holland had been with us on the platform
      when the Chinese teetotalers came here to protest against the public
      houses in England; she says that his backsliding will put back the cause a
      quarter of a century. Then there are the other churchwardens; they look on
      me as if I had been making a suggestion to raffle the sacred plate. George
      Holland has a run for his money, but I&rsquo;ve had no fun out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It does seem hard,&rdquo; said Courtland. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s plain that the case calls
      for persecution, and why not persecute you? Someone must be persecuted,
      you&rsquo;ll admit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why the&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that your good old Bunyip would look in on us before long,&rdquo;
       said Courtland. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no possibility of discussing delicate points in
      theology without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we had better go home,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must have some consideration for our host,&rdquo; said Courtland. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
      all play the part of <i>Cagliostro</i> to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During the movement of her circle and the adjustment of wraps, preparatory
      to the delivery of a valedictory word of congratulation to the great
      actor, Ella said in a low tone to Herbert Courtland:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cagliostro? No; we didn&rsquo;t all play the part; but&mdash;well, Cagliostro
      was a weaver of spells.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause before he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but the art did not die with him. He had a daughter to whom he
      taught his art.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I ever heard of,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;What do you think of Phyllis
      Ayrton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that she is the dearest friend of my dearest friend,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I should like her to become the dearest friend of my dearest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be impossible,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the felicitous valedictory word was said to the great actor and
      actress, and Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s carriage received Phyllis. Lord Earlscourt took
      a seat in Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s hansom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think about Mr. Courtland?&rdquo; inquired Ella of her dearest
      friend, as they lay back with their heads very close together.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause before Phyllis replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what I think about him. He is, I suppose, the bravest
      man alive at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Is that the result of your half hour&rsquo;s chat with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no! but all the same, it&rsquo;s pleasant for a girl to feel that she
      has been talking to a brave man. It gives one a sense of&mdash;of&mdash;is
      it of being quite safe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, no! just the opposite&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;Oh, you
      don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind. Tell me what he talked about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everything! God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that it was in the air. He has ideas, I believe. He never talked
      on that topic to me. I hope you found him to be quite sound,
      theologically.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it seems rather funny, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Phyllis; &ldquo;but I really don&rsquo;t
      think that when I was listening to him I considered for a moment whether
      he was sound or the opposite in his views.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Funny? It would have been rather funny if you had done that,&rdquo; laughed
      Ella. &ldquo;The question that a healthy girl&mdash;and you are a healthy girl,
      Phyllis&mdash;asks herself after talking to such a man as Herbert
      Courtland is not, Is his theology sound? What healthy girl cares the
      fraction of a farthing about the theology of a man with a face like
      Herbert Courtland&rsquo;s and arms like Herbert Courtland&rsquo;s? You talked with him
      for half an hour, and then come to me and say that you suppose he is the
      bravest man alive in the world. That was right&mdash;quite right. That is
      just what every healthy girl should say. We understand a man&rsquo;s thews and
      sinews; we likewise understand what bravery in a man is, but what do we
      know, or, for that matter, care about his theology, whether it is sound or
      the opposite? Nothing. We don&rsquo;t even care whether he has any theology or
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, Ella! one would fancy that you thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know. You see I met Mr. Courtland quite casually, just as I
      met a dozen men at various places during the week. Why should you question
      me more closely about him than about the dozen other men? He only talked a
      little more widely, and perhaps wildly. His bravery is no more to me than
      his theology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it isn&rsquo;t, Phyllis. But there was the case of George Holland&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very different, Ella. I had engaged myself to marry George
      Holland. It would be impossible for me to marry any man who had shown his
      contempt for&mdash;for everything that I regard as sacred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it would, if you didn&rsquo;t love that man. But if you loved the man&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
      when you come to know what it means to love you will understand all. A
      woman before she loves is&mdash;what is she, an egg before it is hatched?
      That sounds ridiculous. Better say a green chrysalis before it breaks into
      a butterfly; for the transition comes at once. Theology! Oh, my Phyllis,
      haven&rsquo;t you read in history, true history&mdash;novels written by men who
      know us and how we were created, and why&mdash;haven&rsquo;t you read what women
      do when they truly love a man? How they fling every consideration to the
      winds: heaven&mdash;home&mdash;husband&mdash;God&mdash;Mrs. Grundy?
      Theology! Ah, you are a healthy girl. You never cared a scrap for George
      Holland. You were glad when the excuse presented itself in order to throw
      him over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I believe that is quite true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella&rsquo;s cry of surprise, and her laugh that followed, shocked her
      companion, and feeling that this was the case, the one who laughed
      hastened to make her apologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be annoyed with me, dear,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But I really couldn&rsquo;t help
      that laugh when I thought of your earnestness the week before last. Then,
      you will remember, you were in great pain because of the heterodoxy of
      George Holland. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you at that time that you had never loved
      him? You were ready to assure me that you had, and that you were making a
      great sacrifice to your principles?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember very well,&rdquo; said Phyllis, with a sound that was not far
      removed from a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are a puzzle to yourself, you poor little chrysalis,&rdquo; said Ella,
      putting the meteoric feathers playfully down upon the serious face of
      Phyllis&mdash;its seriousness was apparent beneath the light of the
      carriage lamp. &ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t make the attempt to explain anything to me.
      Don&rsquo;t try to reconcile your frankness now with your pretense then, because
      you&rsquo;ll certainly make a muddle of it, and because no such attempt is
      necessary to be made to me. I know something of the girl and her moods&mdash;not
      a great deal, perhaps, but enough to prevent my doing you an injustice.
      You are perfectly consistent, my Phyllis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, consistent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly consistent with your nature as a girl. It is the nature of a
      girl to change with every wind that blows. It is only the female prig who
      acts consistently under all circumstances. In a world the leading of which
      is its men, inconsistency is the best nature of a healthy girl made to be
      loved by men. One doesn&rsquo;t sneer at the weathercock because one hour it
      points to the north and the next to the east. &lsquo;Tis its nature to. &lsquo;Tis our
      nature to change with every breeze of man that bears down on us. That&rsquo;s
      why they love us and detest the prigs. Here we are at your house. I hope
      you don&rsquo;t keep your maid up for you. I would scorn to keep a girl out of
      her bed for the sake of brushing my hair. Good-night, dear, and dream of
      the paradise that awaits you&mdash;a paradise in which there are birds to
      be shot, birds of paradise to make feather fans for women who hold them to
      their bosoms one minute, and the next dispose of them to Mr. and Mme.
      Abednego with last season&rsquo;s opera wrap. There&rsquo;s a parable for you to sleep
      upon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;you?&rdquo; cried Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, as for me, I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;well, I think I&rsquo;ll put my meteor fan on
      the pillow beside my own to-night. I&rsquo;m still newfangled with my toy and&mdash;well,
      I&rsquo;m a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this instant the carriage pulled up to Mr. Ayrton&rsquo;s hall door and the
      footman jumped down from the box to run up the steps and ring the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;I enjoyed my evening greatly, and the drive
      home best of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella Linton&rsquo;s laugh was smothered among the delicate floss of the feathers
      which she held up to her face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IT IS THE PRICE OF BLOOD.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Phyllis had a good deal to think of after she had sat for half an hour
      with her father in the room where they worked together for the
      discomfiture of the opposite party, and had given him some account of the
      representation of the play at the Parthenon. Her father was delighted to
      find her in high spirits. So many people come back from the theater
      looking glum and worn out, yawning and mumbling when asked what they have
      seen and what it had all been about. Phyllis was not glum, nor did she
      mumble. She was able to describe scene after scene, and more than once she
      sprang from her seat, carried away by her own powers of description, and
      began to act the bits that had impressed her&mdash;bits the force of which
      could only be understood when described with gestures and pretty
      posturing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father thought he had never seen anything so pretty in his life. (What
      a girl she was, to be sure, to have so easily recovered from the effects
      of that terrible ordeal through which she had passed&mdash;having to
      dismiss at a moment&rsquo;s notice the man whom she had promised to marry!) He
      had certainly never seen anything so fascinating as her pretty posturing,
      with the electric lights gleaming over her white neck with its gracious
      curves, and her firm white arms from which her gloves had been stripped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been his intention to describe to her a scene which had taken place
      in the House of Commons that night&mdash;a scene of Celt and Saxon
      mingling in wild turmoil over a question of neglected duty on the part of
      a Government official: not the one who was subsequently decorated by the
      sovereign a few days after his neglect of duty had placed the country in
      jeopardy, and had precipitated the downfall of the ministry and the
      annihilation of his party as a political factor; not this man, but
      another, who had referred to Trafalgar Square as the private thoroughfare
      of the crown. The scene had been an animated one, and Mr. Ayrton had hoped
      to derive a good deal of pleasure from describing it to his daughter; but
      when he had listened to her, and watched her for a few minutes, he came to
      the conclusion that it would be absurd for him to make an effort to
      compete with her. What was his wretched little story of Parliamentary
      squalor compared with these psychological subtleties which had interested
      his daughter all the evening?
    </p>
    <p>
      He listened to and watched that lovely thing, overflowing with the
      animation that comes from a quick intelligence&mdash;a keen appreciation
      of the intelligence of the great artists who had interpreted a story which
      thrilled the imagination of generation after generation, and he felt that
      Parliament was a paltry thing. Parliament&mdash;what was Parliament? The
      wrangle of political parties over a paltry issue. It had no real life in
      it; it had nothing of the fullness and breadth of the matters that
      interested such people as had minds&mdash;imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tired,&rdquo; she cried at last. &ldquo;It is thoughtless of me to keep you
      out of your bed. You have had a weary night, I am sure. Was it the Irish
      again, or the horrid teetotalers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was both, my dear,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Phyllis,&rdquo; he added solemnly, &ldquo;an Irish
      teetotaler is a fearful thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall forget all the intemperate teetotalers in a beautiful sleep,&rdquo;
       said she, putting her arms around his neck. &ldquo;Good-night, papa! It was so
      thoughtless of me to keep you up. It is one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It appears to me that you are the one who should be ready to succumb,&rdquo;
       said her father. &ldquo;I had nothing to stimulate my imagination. Practical
      politics has not yet discovered a good working reply to the man who calls
      his fellow-man a liar, so the political outlook is not very cheering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what is greatly needed: a satisfactory retort&mdash;verbal, of
      course&mdash;to that every-day assertion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has become the most potent influence in the House of Commons, during
      the past year or two; and the worst of the matter is that the statement is
      nearly always correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is all the greater need for a <i>modus vivendi</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she
      had an ample acquaintance with the jargon of diplomacy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t despair
      of Parliament being able to suggest an efficient retort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Parliament: two ragamuffins quarreling up an entry over a rotten orange.
      Good-night, my child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was at last in her own room: an apartment of gracious-tinted fabrics
      and pink satin panels; of tapestried sofas made by French artists before
      the lovely daughter of Maria Teresa went to her death. She switched on the
      lights in the candle sconces, and threw herself down upon one of the
      sofas. Her theater wrap and fan she had laid over a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not to the drama which she had seen superbly acted at the Parthenon
      that her thoughts went out; but to the words which her dearest friend had
      spoken when driving back from the theater.
    </p>
    <p>
      What words were they?
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not recollect them now; but she was still conscious of the
      impression which they had produced upon her while they were being spoken.
      That impression was that up to that instant all the issues of her life had
      been unworthy of a moment&rsquo;s consideration. She had taken what she believed
      to be a deep interest in many matters during the five years that she had
      been the head of her father&rsquo;s house. She had, she knew, been of the
      greatest help to her father in his political life, not merely turning her
      memory to good account in discovering the incautious phrases in the
      speeches of the men who were foolish enough to be his opponents, but
      actually advising him, when he asked her, on many matters about which the
      newspapers had been full. Then she had taken an active part in more than
      one of those &ldquo;movements&rdquo; which became the topic of a London season until
      compelled by an invisible but all-powerful authority to move on and make
      way for the next new thing. She had moved with every movement, and had
      proved her capacity to control herself when the movement became
      uncontrollable. And then she had thought how worthy a position in life
      would be that of the wife of the rector of a church like St. Chad&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      That idea had remained with her, as had already been said, for some
      months, until, to be exact in regard to the date, the other young women,
      whom she had been watching with interest, had bought their brilliant
      blouses with the newest and, consequently, most abnormal sleeves, casting
      aside the sober-hued bodices which they had worn in hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      How paltry were all these aspirations, these undertakings!
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what was dinning in her ears all the time Ella had been talking
      in the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But why, why, why should all her previous interests, including the
      consideration of the questions of orthodoxy and the other thing, seem so
      ridiculously small while Ella was speaking?
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the question which puzzled her. Had Ella shown her a way to
      something better, something higher, something better worthy of the
      aspiration of a woman? She could not say that that had been the drift of
      her large discourse. What she had said had actually been puzzling in its
      vagueness, its daring images&mdash;all images are vague; its allegories&mdash;all
      allegories are indefinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      With a motion of impatience Phyllis sprang to her feet. After a pause she
      went to a little satin-wood cabinet which she had turned into a bookshelf,
      and took out her Bible. She had never slept a night for years without
      reading a chapter; and in order to avert the possibility of her own
      feelings or fancies of the moment making any invidious distinction between
      the various component parts of a book which is profitable in every line,
      she had accustomed herself to read the chapters in consecutive order from
      The Genesis to The Revelation. Sometimes, when she found herself face to
      face of a night with a purely genealogical chapter, Phyllis of Philistia
      had difficulty in crushing down her unworthy desire to turn to some
      chapter that seemed to her frail judgment to contain words of wider
      comfort to the children of men than a genealogical tree of the Children of
      Israel; but she had never yielded to so unworthy an impulse. Who was she
      that she should suggest that one part of the Sacred Book was calculated to
      be more profitable than another? Was it not all the Bible?
    </p>
    <p>
      She had plowed her way through the slough of Hebrew names upon these
      occasions, and the blessing of the words had been borne to her in the form
      of a sweet sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her chapter for this night was that which describes the campaign of David,
      during which he and his hosts were besieged in their earthworks, and how
      the three mighty men had made a sortie through the camp of the enemy in
      order to obtain for their leader a cup of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued the chapter to the end, but all through it those words were
      ringing in her ears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the price of blood; it is the price of blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as she knelt down beside her bed, her bare white feet peeping out from
      beneath the drapery of her white night-dress, in a posture that would have
      made the most human atheist believe in the beauty of devotion, those words
      were still in her ears: &ldquo;The price of blood; the price of blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Good Heavens! How could she carry that feather fan? How could Ella Linton
      hold it up to her face&mdash;hold her face down to it, flutter its fairy
      fluff upon her cheeks? It was the price of blood. Herbert Courtland had
      run a greater risk to obtain those feathers than David&rsquo;s mighty men had
      run to draw the water from the well. She had heard all about the
      insatiable savagery of the natives of New Guinea. Paradise? Who had named
      those birds the birds of paradise? She recollected how the feathers which
      Ella had whirled about had held in the very center of every wonderful disc
      of rich purple, edged with unequal radiating lines of gold, a single spot
      of brilliant crimson, with a tiny star of silver in the center. The effect
      of the sunlight glinting over this combination on the thousand feathers
      that swept after the bird had caused Herbert Courtland, the first white
      man who had seen this glory of glories, to call it the meteor-bird. But
      those crimson drops: were they not the blood of the men who had perished
      miserably while endeavoring to wrest its marvels from the tropical forests
      of that great island?
    </p>
    <p>
      Paradise?
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ella could treat those feathers as though they had been plucked from a
      tame pheasant? And now she was lying in her bed with the fan on the pillow
      beside her!
    </p>
    <p>
      How could she do it? That was what the girl asked herself while she lay
      awake on her own bed. Would Ella not see, on the white pillow beside her
      head, the crimson stains of the feathers that had been snatched out of the
      dripping red hand of death, but the man who had not feared to grapple with
      death itself in that hell which people called a paradise?
    </p>
    <p>
      But the man, the man who had gripped death by the throat and had torn the
      feathers from his grisly, fleshless fingers,&mdash;her imagination was
      very vivid at night, especially after reading a thrilling chapter of
      Hebrew massacre,&mdash;that man had talked with her upon such trifles as
      books and plays, strange pageants enacted among paper and canvas
      unrealities of life. She had actually been leaning against some of these
      painted scenes while the man who had fought his way into the depths of
      that forest which no white man but himself had yet penetrated,&mdash;the
      man whose life had, day by day and night by night, been dependent upon the
      accuracy of his rifle aim,&mdash;had talked with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was really the sum of all her thoughts. She did not try to recall the
      words that he had spoken; it was simply the figure of the man who had been
      before her that now remained on her mind. She did not stop to think
      whether or not he had spoken as a man with intellect would speak; whether
      he had spoken as a man whose orthodoxy was beyond suspicion would speak.
      The question of his orthodoxy, of his intellect (which may be just the
      opposite), did not occur to her. All she felt was that she had been
      talking face to face with a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that the result of her evening&rsquo;s entertainment, after she had read her
      inspiring chapter in the Bible and said her bedside prayer, she might have
      defined in precisely the same words as she had spoken to her friend Ella
      when Ella had asked her, immediately on entering the carriage, what she
      thought of Herbert Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the bravest man in the world at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not fall asleep for a considerable time.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I&rsquo;M AFRAID THAT I MUST HAVE PRINCIPLE ON MY SIDE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite ridiculous, besides being untrue,&rdquo; said Phyllis, when she had
      read the article in the newspaper to which her father called her attention
      one morning, a week after the criticism on &ldquo;Cagliostro&rdquo; had appeared. The
      article was headed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DYNAMITE VERSUS EVANGELIZATION,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      and it came out in a weekly paper devoted to the interests of
      Nonconformists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is with the deepest regret that we have to call the attention of our
      readers and the public [the article ran] to the series of charges brought
      by the Revs. Joseph Capper and Evans Jones, the eminent pioneers of the
      Nonconformist Eastern Mission, against a gentleman to whom a considerable
      amount of honor is just now being given by the Royal Geographical Society,
      the Ethnological Institute, the Ornithological Association, and other
      secular organizations, on account of his exploration in the Island of New
      Guinea. It is scarcely necessary to say that we allude to Mr. Herbert
      Courtland. The position which has been occupied for several years by the
      two distinguished ministers whose self sacrifice in endeavoring to spread
      the Light through the dark places of the tropical forests of a savage land
      is well known to the subscribers to the N. E. M., precludes the
      possibility of a mistake being made in this matter, and yet they declare
      in a letter which we publish this morning that the manner in which Mr.
      Courtland pursued his so-called explorations in the forests which line the
      banks of the Fly River has practically made impossible all attempts at
      mission work in that region. In several directions it is not denied that
      Mr. Courtland entered into friendly relations with some native tribes; but
      instead of endeavoring to make the poor benighted creatures acquainted
      with the Truth, he actually purchased as slaves over a hundred of them to
      aid him in penetrating the Kallolu forest, where, it will be remembered,
      he succeeded in shooting the much illustrated meteor-bird, as well as
      several other specimens which will delight the members of the
      Ornithological Association rather than professing Christians. Our
      distinguished correspondents state, and we have no room to doubt their
      word, that Mr. Courtland purchased his slaves by a promise to assist the
      head man of their tribe against his enemies belonging to another tribe&mdash;a
      promise which he only too amply fulfilled, the result being an
      indiscriminate slaughter of savages who, though avowed cannibals, might
      eventually have embraced the truths of Nonconformity. The elephant rifles
      of the explorer did their deadly work only too efficiently; but we trust
      that, for his own sake, Mr. Courtland will be able to bring forward
      trustworthy evidence to rebut the suspicion of his having upon at least
      one occasion induced even the friendly natives to believe that he
      possessed the power of the Deity to perform miracles, and upon another
      occasion of having used dynamite against them by which hundreds were
      destroyed in cold blood. It is the evil influences of such irresponsible
      men as Mr. Courtland, whose ill-directed enterprise we cannot in justice
      to him refrain from acknowledging, that retard the efforts of those noble
      pioneers of Nonconformity who have already made such sacrifices for the
      cause, and who rejoice at the difficulties with which they find themselves
      beset. We understand that a question will be put to the Minister for the
      Annexation Department in the House of Commons toward the latter end of the
      week, on the subject of the alleged excesses of the most recent explorer
      (so-called) of New Guinea&mdash;excesses which if committed in Bulgaria or
      Armenia, or even Ireland, would have called for an expression of the
      horror of Christian Europe; and we may mention that subscriptions on
      behalf of the Revs. Joseph Capper and Evans Jones will be received at the
      office of this paper to enable them to substantiate the truth of their
      statements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite ridiculous, besides being untrue, papa,&rdquo; cried Phyllis; &ldquo;and
      I hope that you will not fail to take his part and show the falsehood of
      such accusations. Could anything be more absurd than that about the
      slaves? Slaves! Dynamite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leading up to subscriptions&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that,&rdquo; said her father.
      &ldquo;If subscriptions are to be forthcoming, they must be got up. Traffic in
      human flesh, insults to aborigines, Siberia, the conversion of the Jews&mdash;all
      these appeal directly to the pockets of the Great English People. Any one
      of them will constitute an excellent peg on which to hang an appeal to the
      pocket. Those two distinguished pioneers of&mdash;well, shall we say
      civilization or Nonconformity?&mdash;understand their business, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no part of their business to try and hold a brave man up to the
      execration of everyone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that. The technicalities of the mission field are not
      so apparent all at once. The Vineyard&mdash;well, the system of
      vine-culture of some of the organizations is a trifle obscure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis became impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The House of Commons&mdash;a question is to be asked in the House. Then
      you must ask another, papa, showing the nonsense of the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens above! Why should I be dragged into the quarrel, if it is a
      quarrel, of Herbert Courtland on the one hand and the Reverends Joseph
      Capper and what&rsquo;s the other, Smith&mdash;no, Jones&mdash;Evans Jones? I
      shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he is of Welsh extraction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will surely not stand passively by and hear a brave man slandered.
      That would be unlike you, papa. No; you are bound to protest against the
      falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I indeed? Why? Because the slandered man, if he is slandered, is the
      friend of my daughter&rsquo;s friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly&mdash;that&rsquo;s quite sufficient for you to go upon&mdash;that and
      the falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is a falsehood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If&mdash;oh, papa&mdash;if?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I have your personal guarantee that the statements are unsubstantiated&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you are beginning to jest. I cannot jest on so serious an issue.
      Think of it&mdash;slaves&mdash;dynamite!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both excellent words for missionaries to send home to England&mdash;almost
      equal to opium and idols from the standpoint of the mission-box.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis was solemn for a moment; then she burst into a merry laugh that
      only wanted a note of merriment to be delightful. Her father did not miss
      that note. He was thinking of another phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, why shouldn&rsquo;t you say that or something like that, my father?&rdquo; cried
      the girl. &ldquo;Something to set the House laughing before the Minister of the
      Annexation Department has had time to reply? You can do it, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I could,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton thoughtfully. &ldquo;But why, my child;
      why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Why! Oh, if one only said good things when there was a reason for
      saying them, how dull we should all be! Any stick for a dog&mdash;any jest
      is good enough for the House of Commons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but suppose it is inferred that I am not on the side of the
      missionaries? What about Hazelborough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hazelborough was the constituency which Mr. Ayrton represented in the
      House of Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear father, where would you be if you couldn&rsquo;t steer through the
      Hazelborough prejudices now and again? You can always say something so
      good as to make people not care which way it cuts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Oh, Phyllis! I am ashamed of you. Besides, the people of
      Hazelborough have got to be extremely sensitive. They have caught the
      Nonconformist Conscience. The bacillus of the Nonconformist Conscience was
      rampant a short time ago, and it has not yet been stamped out. I&rsquo;m afraid
      that I must have principle on my side&mdash;some show of principle, at any
      rate&mdash;not so wide as a church door or so deep as a well, but still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you will, too, papa. I&rsquo;ll see Ella and get her to find out from Mr.
      Courtland what is the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps it mightn&rsquo;t be wise to rush into extremes all at once! I
      wouldn&rsquo;t insist on the truth, if I were you. What&rsquo;s the House of Commons
      that it should be cockered up with the truth? All that is needed is enough
      to go on with. An electro-plating of veracity is in keeping with the
      economic tendencies of the age.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not afraid of the truth,&rdquo; cried Phyllis, without giving the cynicism
      of her father the tribute of a smile. &ldquo;Mr. Courtland would, I know, be
      incapable of doing anything unworthy of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us say an explorer,&rdquo; suggested her father. He knew that the word
      which was in her mind was <i>Englishman</i>. She only checked herself when
      her imagination caused her to perceive the average silk-hatted man with
      his tongue in his cheek at the utterance of the phrase. &ldquo;Let us say
      &lsquo;unworthy of an explorer,&rsquo;&rdquo; repeated her father; &ldquo;that is an elastic
      phrase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis was irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have talked with him,&rdquo; she said a trifle coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have said that I know Ella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet Ella is a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the charges are too ridiculous! Slaves! What nonsense! We all know
      what slavery is. Well, where are his slaves now? If he only hired the
      natives for a month or two they were only servants, not slaves. The thing
      is manifestly ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why should we trouble ourselves with the attempt to rebut it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because so many people are idiots nowadays,&rdquo; cried Phyllis warmly.
      &ldquo;Because, no matter how ridiculous a charge which is brought against a
      distinguished person may be, some people will be found ready to believe in
      its truth. Never mind; I&rsquo;ll find out the truth; I&rsquo;ll go to Ella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fountain-head indeed,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton. &ldquo;When in search of the truth,
      go to a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, at any rate,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she went thither.

      CHAPTER XII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DYNAMITE&mdash;SLAVE-DEALING&mdash;MASSACRES&mdash;ARMENIA!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Phyllis, of course, knew when to go to Ella with the certainty of finding
      her at home. At the luncheon hour Mrs. Linton was always visible to the
      three friends whom she had within the confines of Mayfair. She considered
      herself blessed among women in the numerical strength of her friendships;
      and so perhaps she was; she had three.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in one of her drawing rooms&mdash;the one that was decorated with
      water colors set in fluted panels of yellow silk&mdash;not the one with
      the pink blinds so beloved by those of her visitors who had reached an age
      to regard a pink light as a woman&rsquo;s best friend. She was wearing a new
      gown which Phyllis, in spite of her enthusiasm on behalf of a brave man
      maligned, found admirable both as regards fabric, fit, and fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a word or two of commendation of the artists who had been
      concerned in its production. They had not been absurd about the sleeves,
      and they had not vetoed the sweep of lace&mdash;it was about half a yard
      wide&mdash;which the person who occupied so insignificant a position as is
      usually allocated to the mere wearer of the gown had suggested for the
      bodice. The gown was an unequivocal success, and had Ella seen the
      disgraceful article which had appeared in the <i>Spiritual Aneroid</i> on
      the subject of Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s explorations?
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella smiled a slow smile, as the question joined the congratulation
      without the lapse of a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Spiritual Aneroid</i>? Who is the <i>Spiritual Aneroid</i>? What
      is the <i>Spiritual Aneroid</i>?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Oh, a newspaper. What could
      a newspaper with such a funny name have to say about Mr. Courtland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have brought it with me,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;It is quite disgraceful. I&rsquo;m
      sure you&rsquo;ll agree with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m certain of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella accepted the proffered paper and glanced down the article pointed out
      to her by Phyllis. Phyllis&rsquo; eyes were gleaming as she placed her finger on
      the words, &ldquo;Dynamite <i>versus</i> Evangelization,&rdquo; but Ella&rsquo;s eyes did
      not gleam while she was reading all the words printed beneath the heading.
      She folded the paper and glanced carelessly at the name at the top of the
      outside page and said, &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there ever anything so disgraceful?&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;Was there every
      anything so false?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it false?&rdquo; asked Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you doubt it? Do you fancy that Mr. Courtland would be a
      slave-dealer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how he&rsquo;d look in the broad flat hat which appears in all the
      pictures of the slave-dealers? Rather well, I fancy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Linton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, how can you talk of his looking well or ill when you read such an
      attack upon him?&rdquo; said Phyllis, jumping up with a charmingly rosy face.
      &ldquo;Surely it is something to you when so distinguished a man&mdash;your
      friend as well&mdash;is attacked!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we were traveling with him across the desert in a caravan, should we
      mind much if the whole caravan were attacked by Bedouins or missionaries
      or people of that stamp, my dear? Of course we shouldn&rsquo;t. We should feel
      that he would be equal to the defense of all of us, and himself as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course; but this is quite another thing, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the difference? If anybody minds the nonsense printed in that
      thing, Herbert Courtland will certainly be able to defend himself when
      called on to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis seated herself once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a question is to be asked in Parliament about him?&rdquo; she suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And can you, the daughter of a member of that Parliament, honestly tell
      me that you fancy that any human being minds how many questions are asked
      about him in the Questionable House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the least breath of suspicion&mdash;dynamite&mdash;slave-dealing&mdash;massacres&mdash;Armenia.
      Oh, the article is certain to be copied into dozens of other papers&mdash;the
      public do so like to get hold of some scandal against a man who has done
      something great.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do indeed. Would you suggest organizing a committee of ladies for
      the protection of Mr. Courtland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Ella. I though that you were his friend, and that
      you would be as indignant as I was at that disgraceful attack upon his
      reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that it will place his reputation in jeopardy, unless with
      the readers of that paper, and they are not worth taking into account, are
      they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa says the thing has a large circulation among a certain class. I want
      him to ridicule the question which is threatened in that article; he knows
      how to do that kind of thing very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it come to that, my Phyllis? Were you really so greatly interested in
      the one conversation you had with him as to constitute yourself his
      champion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Above all things Phyllis was truthful. She had never had an experience of
      love&mdash;that passion which can change the most truthful of womankind
      into the least scrupulous. There was no pause between Ella&rsquo;s question and
      Phyllis&rsquo; answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly the one conversation that I had with him interested me&mdash;I
      told you so returning in the carriage. Has he never succeeded in
      interesting you, Ella? He told me that you were his friend&mdash;I believe
      he said his dearest friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I believe that he told you the truth,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;But, being his
      best friend and a woman, I refrain from constituting myself his champion.
      You see we live in Philistia, my Phyllis, and the champions that Philistia
      sends forth usually come to grief; there was the case of one Goliath of
      Gath, for example. I have no desire to have stones slung at me by the
      chosen people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite sure that I understand you,&rdquo; said Phyllis, with a very
      pretty pucker on her forehead. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that a woman should
      not do her best for a man whom she knows to be maligned? You don&rsquo;t suggest
      that she should stand silently to one side while people are saying what&rsquo;s
      false about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say that it&rsquo;s unwise in Philistia; though I admit that it is of the
      greatest advantage to the man, for people at once cease maligning him and
      take to maligning her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she is any sort of a woman she will not mind that, however unjust it
      may be. In this case, however, I don&rsquo;t think there is much risk: even the
      most unscrupulous person could hardly say that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That we were becoming Herbert Courtland&rsquo;s champions, because we were in
      love with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Wasn&rsquo;t that what you meant to suggest people would
      say of a woman who became a man&rsquo;s champion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something in that way. How straightforwardly you speak out what&rsquo;s on your
      mind!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a girl of to-day. I have got over all those absurd affectations
      of childishness which used to be thought feminine long ago. The gambols of
      the kitten were once thought the most attractive thing on earth, and they
      are very interesting: but for the full-grown cat to pretend that it is
      perfectly happy with a ball of worsted, when all the time it has its heart
      set on a real mouse, is nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is an allegory, a subtle parable, Phyllis. But I fancy I can
      interpret it. You are quite right. Men know that we, the full-grown cats,
      take no interest in the ravelings of wool as mediums of diversion&mdash;that
      we have our hearts set on mice. Oh, yes! it is much better to be
      straightforward in our speech&mdash;it is even sometimes better to be
      quite straight in our ways as well. It usually prevents misunderstanding.
      There is scarcely a subject that women may not talk about to men in the
      most direct way, nowadays. But about the question of championship&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the door of the room was thrown open and Mr. Herbert Courtland was
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I quite forgot to mention that Mr. Courtland was lunching with us to-day,
      Phyllis,&rdquo; said Ella, while shaking hands with her visitor. &ldquo;Now you will
      have a chance of getting the slave-dealer&rsquo;s account of the whole business.
      Are you a slave-dealer, Bertie? If so, why don&rsquo;t you wear the usual
      broad-leaved hat of your order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is I who am the enslaved one,&rdquo; said Mr. Courtland, laying his hand to
      the left of the buttons of his white waistcoat and bowing the bow of the
      early years of the century, with a glance at each lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a pretty reminiscence of the age of artificiality!&rdquo; said Ella; &ldquo;and
      what an apt commentary upon the subject we were talking about, Phyllis! We
      were discussing the merits of directness in speech and straightness in
      every way. We were ridiculing the timid maid&mdash;all sandals and simper&mdash;of
      forty years ago. Why should men and women have ever taken the trouble to
      be affected? Let us go in to lunch and eat with the appetites of men and
      women of the nineties, not with the nibblings of society of the fifties.
      Come along, Phyllis. Mr. Courtland will tell us all about his dreadful
      goings on, his slave-dealings, his dynamitings. Have you seen that article
      in the&mdash;what&rsquo;s the name of the paper, Phyllis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>Spiritual Aneroid</i>,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been so fortunate,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we shall take the paper into the dining room with us, and place it
      before you. If you were guilty of the doings that the article details, you
      would do well to&mdash;to&mdash;well, to adopt the picturesque costume
      incidental to ruffianism&mdash;the linen jacket of the slave-trader, the
      mangy fur collar of the dynamity man of war. Have you ever trafficked in
      human beings, Mr. Courtland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have done a little in that way, I admit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And dynamite&mdash;have you ever massacred people with dynamite?&rdquo; Ella
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when my dynamite exploded, the people who were in the immediate
      neighborhood were never just the same afterward,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally, did you allow yourself to be worshiped as God?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I got them to do that,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I have experienced all human
      sensations, including those of a god in working order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope you will make a good lunch. We begin with white-bait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite satisfied to begin with white-bait,&rdquo; said he.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      EVEN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DOESN&rsquo;T MATTER MUCH.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not intend to stay for lunch,&rdquo; said Phyllis, &ldquo;but your overpowering
      will swept me along with it, Ella. But I hope you will let me say that I
      don&rsquo;t think you should jest about what is&mdash;what some people at any
      rate think very serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phyllis is of Philistia,&rdquo; said Ella, &ldquo;and Philistia was always given to
      ordeal by champions. She thinks the attack made upon you by two
      missionaries in their newspaper organ quite disgraceful. It doesn&rsquo;t seem
      so disgraceful after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen the attack,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But I feel it to be very good of
      Miss Ayrton to think it disgraceful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I thought it disgraceful,&rdquo; said Phyllis, &ldquo;and I came to Ella to
      talk it all over. The article accuses you of atrocities, and said that a
      question would shortly be put to the Minister of the Annexation Department
      in the House of Commons. Now, I know that there is nothing my father
      enjoys more than snubbing those detestable men who endeavor to get up a
      reputation for philanthropy, and temperance, and bimetallism, and other
      virtues, by putting questions on the paper; and he could, I think, ask
      some counter question in this particular case that would ridicule the
      original busybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very good of you to think so, Miss Ayrton,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say
      that, personally, I mind all the attacks that all the missionaries who
      earn precarious salaries in South Seas may make upon me; but I must
      confess that I have a weakness for seeing busybodies put to shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may depend upon Mr. Ayrton&rsquo;s satire,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;It never misses the
      point in the harness. The barb of the dart is, I believe, Mr. Ayrton&rsquo;s,
      the feather at the other end is Phyllis&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only once that happened,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;Oh, no! papa manufactures his
      own darts, from feather to tip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But supposing that the charges brought against me are true?&rdquo; suggested
      Mr. Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, can&rsquo;t you see there is all the greater need for ingenuity in
      your defense?&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is impossible to think of the charges as true,&rdquo; said Phyllis stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For example?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the article said that you had made slaves of some of the natives of
      New Guinea, purchasing them by a promise to help a native chief against
      his enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t much harm in that: I did it,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then it went on to say that you kept your promise,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! They accused me of keeping my promise?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m afraid
      I can&rsquo;t deny that charge either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you really slaughter the natives?&rdquo; cried Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest which she felt appeared in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did my best for the savages who had purchased my services,&rdquo; he replied.
      &ldquo;The campaign was not a protracted one. Two days after the outbreak of
      hostilities brought things to a climax. We fought our decisive battle&mdash;the
      Sedan of King Mubamayo. You see, I had a trustworthy Winchester. I believe
      that about seventy of the enemy bit the dust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only seventy? That was unworthy of you, Mr. Courtland,&rdquo; cried Ella.
      &ldquo;Nothing short of thousands counts as a civilized battle. Seventy! Oh, I&rsquo;m
      afraid you don&rsquo;t do yourself justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course a battle is a battle,&rdquo; said Phyllis stoutly. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t
      killed them they would have killed you. You were in the right, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; said he, shaking his head. &ldquo;To tell you the
      truth, the elements of the crisis of Headman Glowabyola were somewhat
      involved. The original dispute was difficult for a foreigner to understand&mdash;it
      was, in fact, the Schleswig-Holstein question of Kafalonga.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You settled it, anyway,&rdquo; suggested Ella. &ldquo;You were the Bismarck of
      what&rsquo;s-its-name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubled the parts of Bismarck and Von Moltke,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why they worshiped you as their god? I don&rsquo;t wonder at the
      heathen in his blindness doing that. Any man who was the same as Bismarck
      and Von Moltke would certainly shoulder a deity out of his way,&rdquo; laughed
      Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It so happened, however, that my deification was due neither to my
      recognition as a diplomatist nor as a military strategist,&rdquo; said the
      explorer. &ldquo;No, they wanted something beyond the mere fighting man to
      worship, and my knowledge of that fact combined with their paeans of
      victory&mdash;to the <i>obbligato</i> of a solid iron-wood drum beaten
      with the thigh bones of the conquered&mdash;to keep me awake at night. But
      one morning the headman came upon me when I was about to boil my kettle to
      make myself a cup of tea. I had a small lamp that burned spirits, and he
      stood by while I filled it up from the bottle that I carried with me. He
      took it for granted that the spirit was water, and he was greatly
      impressed when he saw it flare up as I applied a lighted match to it. He
      asked me if I possessed the power to set water in a blaze, and I assured
      him that that was something for which I had long been celebrated; adding
      that when I had had my breakfast I meant to while away an hour or two by
      setting fire to the ocean itself. He implored of me to reconsider my
      decision, and when I had poured a little spirit into the hollow of my hand
      and lighted it in the presence of his most eminent scientists, they said
      that they also desired to associate themselves with the headman&rsquo;s
      petition. I was, however, inexorable; I walked down to the beach and had
      just struck a match on the brink of the ocean when the whole tribe
      prostrated themselves around me, promising to continue worshiping me if I
      would only stay my hand. Well, what could I do? I weakly yielded and
      spared the multitudinous sea from being the medium of what would in all
      likelihood have been the greatest conflagration on record. From that
      moment, I&rsquo;m happy to say, they worshiped me as their supreme deity, and
      I&rsquo;m bound to say that I behaved as such; I was certainly the most superior
      class of god they had ever had, and they gave me a testimonial to this
      effect in case I might ever be looking out for a new situation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was how you managed to get such a collection of birds, including my
      meteor-bird,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;But Phyllis of Philistia is shocked at the bare
      recital of such a tale of idolatry. Are you not, Phyllis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am a little shocked,&rdquo; said Phyllis. She did not say that her
      first thought just then was that the feather fan was not, after all, the
      price of blood: it was something much worse. &ldquo;It was an encouragement of
      idolatry, was it not, Mr. Courtland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;On the contrary, it was an honest attempt to lead
      them from their idols to something higher and better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are something higher and better,&rdquo; suggested Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so; I am a little lower than the angels, but a good deal higher
      than the awful image which they worshiped before I turned up,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;The whole tribe admitted in the most honorable manner that I was by far
      the best god they had ever had; they had not an unlucky day so long as
      they worshiped me, and I retained my Winchester and a full supply of
      cartridges.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The testimony was flattering,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;But still Phyllis is shocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;I believe in God. Mr. Courtland believes in a
      Principle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, I led some thousands of savages from idolatry and cannibalism to
      something higher, and that&rsquo;s a better record than most gods of my
      acquaintance can show. Everything must be done gradually to be done
      permanently. Nothing could be more absurd than the <i>modus operandi</i>
      of your missionary. Most of them have got rid of their Christianity to
      make way for their theology. They endeavor to inculcate upon the natives
      the most subtle points of their theological system, immediately after they
      have preached against the wickedness of economy in the matter of
      clothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A large missionary work might be done among husbands at home,&rdquo; said Ella.
      &ldquo;But what about the dynamite, that is the charge which still hands over
      you&mdash;a charge of dynamite?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my worst hour,&rdquo; said Courtland. &ldquo;I had gone up the Fly River in
      my steam launch to a point never previously reached by a European. I was
      fortunate enough to get some specimens that had never been seen before,
      and I was returning to the coast. My engineer and I were captured when
      ashore one night getting fuel for our furnace. They took us into the
      forest a long way, binding our hands with the fiber of one of the
      creepers, and I had no trouble whatever gathering that it was their
      intention to make a feast of us&mdash;a sort of high tea, it was to be,
      for they began brewing the herbs which I knew they used only when they
      were cannibalizing. We were courteously permitted to watch these
      preparations, for it was rightly assumed that they would be in some degree
      interesting to us. We were, indeed, greatly interested in all we saw, but
      much more so when, toward evening, a number of the natives arrived on the
      scene carrying with them some of the stores which they had found aboard
      the steam launch. They broke open with a stone hatchet some tins of
      preserved meat, and seemed to enjoy the contents greatly. The biscuits
      they didn&rsquo;t care for much, and the cakes of soap which they began to eat
      could not honestly be said to be an entire success as comestibles. But
      while we watched them at these <i>hors d&rsquo;oeuvres</i> to the banquet at
      which we were expected to take a prominent part, a straggler came up with
      some reserve supplies; I saw them; tins of dynamite&mdash;we carried
      dynamite for blowing up the snags that obstructed the narrower reaches of
      the river. We watched the thieves crowd around the bearer of the tins, and
      we saw that the general impression that prevailed in regard to them was
      that they had come upon some of the most highly concentrated beef they had
      ever had in their hands. When they laid the tins among the hot ashes of
      their fires and began to break them open with their stone hatchets, my
      engineer thought with me that all the interest there would be in the
      subsequent proceedings could not possibly compensate us for the waste of
      precious time which would be entailed by our remaining. We bolted in spite
      of our fettered hands, but before we had got more than a couple of hundred
      yards from the camp, there took place the severest earthquake,
      coincidental with a thunderstorm and the salute of a battery of a thousand
      heavy guns. We were whirled into the air like feathers in a breeze, but
      managed to cling&mdash;our bonds being broken&mdash;to some of the boughs
      among which we found ourselves. Shortly afterward, a quarter of an hour or
      so, there came on the heaviest shower I had ever experienced. Such a
      downpour of branches of trees, gnarled roots, broken fruits, birds&rsquo; 
      feathers, mutilated apes of many species, and&mdash;well, anatomical
      specimens! It went on and on until the boughs around us were made into
      splinters and we were beaten to the ground with the force of those
      missiles, all the dense forest around us echoing to the shrieks of the
      lories and parrots, the monkeys and the wildcats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now the missionaries,&rdquo; said Ella, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened after that?&rdquo; whispered Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that we came away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t see that there was any
      need for us to stay loafing about the forest when we had our business to
      mind in another direction. It took us two days, however, finding our
      launch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is what the missionaries call your dynamite outrage against the
      natives?&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it would seem,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I suppose they managed to get some account
      of the business; one can&rsquo;t hush up a dynamite outrage even in the interior
      of New Guinea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what a gross misrepresentation of facts it was to say that you had
      massacred the natives,&rdquo; cried Phyllis indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we must all live,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless those who treat tins of dynamite as though they were tins of
      brawn,&rdquo; said Ella. Then turning to Phyllis she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis had no difficulty interpreting the smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;your opinion was quite correct: Mr. Courtland doesn&rsquo;t
      care what people say, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter in the least what they do say,
      or what falsehoods are spread abroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the smallest degree,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;Herbert Courtland is still
      Herbert Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But so far as I can gather,&rdquo; said Mr. Courtland, &ldquo;all that the
      missionaries said of me was substantially correct.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read the paper and you will see how detestably false all the charges
      are,&rdquo; cried Phyllis, rising,&mdash;the servants had now left the room,&mdash;and
      picking up the <i>Spiritual Aneroid</i> from where Ella had laid it on a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Courtland had not yet opened it. He took it from her, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Ayrton. But I really don&rsquo;t see that it concerns me very
      much whether or not the charges brought against me are true or false. The
      matter is certainly one for the&mdash;the&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>Spiritual
      Aneroid</i> and its special <i>clientele</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a question is to be asked about it in the House of Commons. I said so
      just now,&rdquo; cried Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And even the House of Commons doesn&rsquo;t matter much,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what papa thought,&rdquo; said Phyllis meekly. &ldquo;Only I know that if Mr.
      Courtland thought it worth noticing, papa would be quite pleased to put a
      counter question. That is why I came here to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so good of you,&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Phyllis is all that is good. Let us return to the drawing room,&rdquo; said
      Ella, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the drawing room; but when they had been in the apartment
      for perhaps four minutes, certainly not five, Phyllis said it was
      necessary for her to hurry home in order that the afternoon letters should
      be sent to her father at the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      With another word of appreciation of her kindness, Mr. Courtland held her
      hand a second longer than was absolutely necessary to maintain a character
      for civility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is the most charming girl in the world,&rdquo; remarked Ella to the
      visitor, who remained when Phyllis had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it. Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have thought nothing about it. If you say she
      is charming, I am pleased to hear it. It matters no more to me that the
      world is full of charming girls than that the kraken is still at the
      bottom of the sea. One woman fills all my thoughts. My heart is full of
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you want her to risk the salvation of her soul for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; that is just what I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He remained with her for another hour.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE HONORABLE MEMBER IS CLEARLY OUT OF ORDER.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton met his daughter the next morning with the good news that he
      had found among his specimen cases of phrases, one that would effectually
      silence the member from Wales who had been nominated by the Nonconformist
      Eastern Missionary Society to put that question to the minister of the
      Annexation Department on the subject of Mr. Courtland, the explorer. Mr.
      Ayrton was the better pleased at his discovery, because of the inoffensive
      nature of the phrase which he had taken out of its case, so to speak. As a
      rule, he did not mind being offensive if only his phrase was apt. Only
      people who had no artistic appreciation found fault with the tone of some
      of his most notable phrases. He did not mind whether they were just or
      unjust, they said. As if a man can be both honest and witty at the same
      time!
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however, that the party to which Mr. Ayrton belonged had
      become greatly concerned in respect of an element that had just come to
      the surface to still further complicate the course of politics. This was
      the Nonconformist Conscience&mdash;hitherto a <i>quantite negligeable</i>
      in the calculations of the leaders, but now one that it appeared
      absolutely necessary to take into account as a factor. To be sure, there
      were a good many people who put their tongues in their cheeks when any
      mention was made of the Nonconformist Conscience: they said it was no more
      to be taken seriously than the Spector on the Brocken or the Athanasian
      Creed. It was only the trick of an electioneering agent desirous of
      escaping from an untenable position.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other persons, however (mostly Nonconformists), who were found
      ready to declare that the Nonconformist Conscience was a Great and Living
      Truth. The only point upon which statesmen of all parties were agreed was
      that it was worth purchasing. The Nonconformists themselves, upon whom the
      Great and Living Truth was sprung, had no notion at first that it could be
      turned into a negotiable security occupying as high a place in the market
      as, say, Argentine bonds. But it did not take them very long to find out
      that even an abstraction such as this could be turned to good account by
      discreet maneuvering. Truth sometimes is heard on an election platform,
      and yet truth is but an abstract quality. Why, then should not a Great and
      Living Truth become a regular gold mine to its inventor? It was as great
      an invention as the art of electroplating, which it closely resembled, and
      a quite as nice thing could be made out of it by a little dexterous
      manipulation. If the conscience is silver, the Nonconformist Conscience is
      at least electroplate of a first-class quality, it was argued; and a
      political manifesto, which was practically a financial prospectus, was
      issued with a view of floating the Nonconformist Conscience Company,
      Limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      English politics cannot by any possibility be regarded as an exact
      science; and thus it was that all political parties were at this time
      making bids for shares in the enterprise. The leaders of one party, in
      fact, expressed themselves ready to buy up the whole concern, and they
      actually tendered bills payable at twelve months for all the vendors&rsquo; 
      interest, and it was only when these bills became due and were returned
      dishonored that the shadowy character of the transaction was made plain,
      and the country was convulsed at the disclosure of the fact that the
      vendors had disposed of a perfectly worthless invention, and that the
      purchasers had paid for it by promises that were equally worthless.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this happened later, however; when the fuss was made about the
      atrocities by an explorer in New Guinea, and Mr. Ayrton was contemplating
      a counter question that should cast ridicule upon the missionaries and
      their champion, he was given to understand by the leaders of his party,
      who, it was believed, had a small parcel of baronetcies done up in
      official twine, with blank spaces for the name and address in each,
      awaiting distribution at the first change of Government, that he must take
      no step that might jeopardize the relations of the party with the vendors
      of the Nonconformists Conscience. The <i>Spiritual Aneroid</i> was the
      leading Nonconformist organ, and it would not do to sneer at the
      missionaries whom it supported. It would be better that all the explorers
      who had ever risked their lives on behalf of civilization should go by the
      board than that a single vote should be lost to the party, he was assured
      by the Senior Whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was rather irritating to the artist in phrases; because it stood to
      reason that the majority of his phrases were calculated to be hurtful to
      his opponents. He was thus quite elated when he came upon something which
      would, he felt sure, call comment in the press at the expense of the
      member from Wales without casting any slight upon Nonconformist Missionary
      enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read out the thing to his daughter, and he was surprised to find that
      she was not appreciative of its unique charm. This was rather too bad, he
      felt, considering that it was she who had enlisted his services in this
      particular matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Courtland wants anybody to take his part in Parliament
      or out of it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I think it would be better to let
      that Mr. Apthomas ask his question without interruption. What can the
      Minister of Annexation say except that he has no information on the
      subject, and that if he had he could not interfere, as he had no
      jurisdiction on the Fly River?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what he will reply as a matter of course,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;But
      that will not prevent the newspapers that are on the side of Wales and the
      missionaries from saying what they please in the way of comment on the
      atrocities in New Guinea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Courtland will not mind whatever they may say,&rdquo; cried Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was the view I took of the matter in regard to Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s
      attitude when you mentioned it to me at first,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose
      that he was the man to be broken down because some foolish paper attacks
      him; but you were emphatic in your denunciation of the injustice that
      would be liable to be done if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I had only spoken for about half an hour to Mr. Courtland then,&rdquo; said
      Phyllis. &ldquo;I think I know him better now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you have spoken with him for another half hour; you therefore know
      him twice as well as you did,&rdquo; remarked her father. &ldquo;I wonder if he
      admitted to you having done all that he was accused of doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw in a moment from the little uneasy movement of her eyes that he had
      made an excellent guess at the general result of the conversation at Mrs.
      Linton&rsquo;s little lunch. He had not yet succeeded in obtaining any details
      from his daughter regarding her visit to Ella. She had merely told him
      that Ella had kept her to lunch, and that Mr. Courtland had been there
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I do believe that he admitted everything,&rdquo; he continued, with a
      laugh as he thought how clever he was. (He had frequent reasons for
      laughing that laugh.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Phyllis doubtfully; &ldquo;he did not admit everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was some reservation? Perhaps it was melinite that he employed for
      the massacre of the innocents of New Guinea, not dynamite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it was dynamite. But the natives had stolen it from his steam launch
      and they exploded it themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton lay back in his chair convulsed with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that is the true story of the dynamite massacre?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That is
      how it comes that, in the words of the <i>Aneroid</i>, the works of
      evangelization on Nonconformist principles is likely to be retarded for
      some time? The missionaries are quite right too. And what about his
      miracles&mdash;they suggested a miracle, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was some foolishness about setting spirits of wine on fire,&rdquo;
       said Phyllis. &ldquo;The natives thought that it was water, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton laughed more heartily than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the crowning infamy,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My dear Phyllis, it would be
      quite impossible to allow so delicious a series of missionary muddles to
      pass unnoticed. I think I see my way clearly in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She knew that he did. She knew that he regarded most incidents in the
      political world merely as feeders to his phrase-making capacity. She knew
      that it would be impossible to repress him now in the matter of Courtland
      and the missionaries; she fully realized the feelings of Frankenstein.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the weakest protest did she make against her father&rsquo;s intended
      action; and thus when the day came for Mr. Apthomas&rsquo; question, that
      gentleman from Wales inquired, &ldquo;If Her Majesty&rsquo;s Minister for Annexations
      could give the House any information regarding the so-called explorations
      of Mr. Herbert Courtland in the island of New Guinea, particularly in
      respect of a massacre of natives by dynamite in the region of the Fly
      River; and if it was true that the gentleman just named had permitted
      himself to be worshiped as a god by the aborigines of another region; and
      if Her Majesty&rsquo;s Minister for Domestic Affairs was prepared to say that it
      was legal for one of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects to assume the privileges and
      functions of a god, and if the First Lord of the Treasury was prepared to
      communicate to the House what course, if any, Her Majesty&rsquo;s government
      meant to adopt with a view to the prevention of similar outrages in the
      same region in the future?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton rose before the Minister of the Annexation Department had quite
      concluded his yawn, and said he trusted that he was in order (cries of
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; from those members who knew that the honorable member had an
      enlivening phrase which he wanted to get rid of) in inquiring, in
      connection with the same subject, if the right honorable gentleman could
      inform the House if there was any truth in the report current in financial
      and other circles that the object of the explorations of Mr. Herbert
      Courtland was the discovery of a small mammal of the porcine tribe, and if
      one of the Law Officers of the Crown was prepared to assure the House that
      it would be contrary to the provisions of the Companies Act, and the
      Companies Act Amendment Act, to permit this New Guinea pig to assume the
      functions of the director of Limited Liability Companies, whose
      directorate was largely composed of members of both Houses of Parliament
      (great laughter from honorable gentlemen who were aware that the Mr.
      Apthomas had no income beyond the remuneration he received as a director
      of companies); and if Her Majesty&rsquo;s Minister for Agriculture was prepared
      to state that it was the intention of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to prohibit
      the introduction of, at any rate the males of the mammals just referred
      to, considering the rapid increase in representative assemblies of the
      English or Welsh bore&mdash;&mdash;(Great laughter, which prevented the
      concluding words of the sentence being audible in the gallery.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SPEAKER: Order! order! The honorable member for Hazelborough must
      confine himself strictly to the issued raised by the honorable gentleman
      from Wales. The honorable member for Hazelborough is only permitted to
      follow the honorable gentleman from Wales by the indulgence of the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. AYRTON: Sir, I bow to the ruling of the chair, and will continue by
      inquiring if Her Majesty&rsquo;s Minister for the Public Worship Department can
      state to the House if it is true that a newspaper published within the
      Principality of Wales recently made the announcement that the honorable
      member who had just made inquiries regarding the exploration of Mr.
      Herbert Courtland, was the idol of his constituents [Laughter, and cries
      of &ldquo;Order!&rdquo;], and if the right honorable gentleman is prepared to state
      that the provisions of the Idolatry Act are&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SPEAKER: The honorable member is clearly out of order. The question of
      idolatry in Wales is not at present before the House.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. AYRTON: Sir, I give notice that next session I shall move a resolution
      regarding idolatry in the Principality of Wales [Laughter and cheers.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The minister for Annexation was about to rise when
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. MUDLARKY (Ballynamuck) asked if the introduction of the guinea pigs
      would be prejudicial to the interests of the higher and nobler Irish
      animal who, he would remind the Minister for Public Worship, was not to be
      confounded with the herd whose example was clearly emulated by the present
      government in seeking self-destruction by running down a steep place into
      the sea. (Cries of &ldquo;Order, order!&rdquo;) If there was any doubt before, the
      honorable member continued, as to the influence which was at work in that
      Gadarene herd, which assumed the functions of Her Majesty&rsquo;s government,
      the sounds that now came from the Treasury Benches would convince even the
      most skeptical that sacred history is sometimes repeated by profane, but
      he could not compliment the devils, who had the bad taste to&mdash;(Several
      honorable members here rose amid the cheers of the Irish Members, and a
      scene of confusion took place.)
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SPEAKER [sternly]: Order, Order! The honorable member from Ballynamuck
      must resume his seat. He is out of order. The question before the House is
      not the good taste of demoniac visitants. I call upon the right honorable
      gentleman, the Minister for the Department of Annexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. McCULLUM (Blairpukey Burghs): Mr. Speaker, one moment. To save time,
      will the right honorable gentleman say if the Highland Crofters, whose
      land was stolen from them in order that the members of the Upper House&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SPEAKER: Order! The Minister for the Department of Annexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. BLISTER (Battersea, Mid): Mr. Speaker, though I don&rsquo;t do any work
      myself, I&rsquo;m the representative of labor, only those contemptible skunks,
      the workingmen, don&rsquo;t see that they have a man for a leader&mdash;a man,
      that&rsquo;s me&mdash;that&rsquo;s Joe Blister. And as the Upper House has been
      introduced, I&rsquo;ll run, eat, or swear with the best of that lot of tap-room
      loafers; I&rsquo;ll do anything but fight them&mdash;except, of course, on a
      labor platform, and if&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SPEAKER: The honorable member is out of order. The Minister for the
      Department of Annexations.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE MINISTER FOR ANNEXATIONS: No, sir; I have no information [Cheers and
      laughter.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The House then went into Committee of Supply.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BUT MR. COURTLAND&mdash;&mdash;AH, NEVER MIND!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton entertained his daughter with a description of the scene in the
      House incidental to the annihilation of Mr. Apthomas. He rather thought
      himself that his counter-question had been neat. He had been congratulated
      on it by quite a number of his friends in the tea room, and six messages
      had been delivered to him by representatives of the press to the effect
      that if he could provide them with the exact text of his counter-question
      they would be greatly obliged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They mean to report it in full?&rdquo; said Phyllis. She had an ample
      experience of the decimation of his questions as well as speeches by the
      members of the press gallery. They had reduced it to a science.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am much mistaken if they don&rsquo;t comment on it as well,&rdquo; said her father.
      &ldquo;Poor Apthomas! he alone sat glum and mute while everyone around him was
      convulsed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that Mr. Courtland will not feel hurt at what has occurred,&rdquo; said
      Phyllis doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Courtland? Who is Mr. Courtland? What has Mr. Courtland to say to the
      matter? What business is it of his, I should like to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, considering that he was the original subject of the questions,
      though I must confess that he didn&rsquo;t remain long so, I don&rsquo;t think it
      altogether unreasonable to wonder what he will think about the whole
      episode,&rdquo; remarked Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you always do take an original view of such incidents,&rdquo; said her
      father indulgently. &ldquo;It is so like a woman to try and drag poor Courtland
      into the business. You ought to know better than to fancy that any
      interest attaches to the original subject of a question in the House.
      You&rsquo;ll be suggesting next that some credit should be given to the youths
      who pass brilliant examinations in things, and that all should not be
      absorbed by their grinders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so silly as that, papa,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;No; but Mr. Courtland&mdash;&mdash;Ah,
      never mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however, that several of the newspapers which commented on
      the questions and counter-questions the next day introduced the name of
      Mr. Herbert Courtland and his explorations; though, of course, most
      attention was directed to what Mr. Ayrton&rsquo;s party called the brilliant,
      and the other party the flippant, methods of Mr. Ayrton. His reference to
      the New Guinea pig some thought a trifle too personal to be in good taste,
      but if politicians refrained from personalities and were punctilious in
      matters of taste, what chance would they have of &ldquo;scoring,&rdquo; and where
      would the caricaturists be? The reputation of a politician is steadily
      built up nowadays, not by consistency, certainly; not by brilliant
      rhetoric; not even by the unscrupulous exercise of a faculty for
      organizing impromptu &ldquo;scenes,&rdquo; but by the wearing of a necktie, or a boot,
      or a waistcoat that is susceptible of caricature. A very ordinary young
      man has before now been lifted into fame by the twists of his mustache,
      and another of less than mediocre ability has been prevented from sinking
      in the flood of forgetfulness by the kindly efforts of a caricaturist who
      supported him by a simple lock on his scalp. Thus it was that Mr. Apthomas
      found himself famous before a week had passed, through the circumstance of
      being represented in the leading journal of caricature as a guinea pig,
      flying, with the spoil of bubble boards of directors under his arm, from
      the attack of a number of quaint-looking mammals wearing collars inscribed
      &ldquo;ACCURACY,&rdquo; &ldquo;CORRECT BALANCE SHEETS,&rdquo; &ldquo;LEGITIMATE SPECULATIONS,&rdquo; and other
      phrases that suggested the need for the old guinea pig to give way to a
      new breed. Underneath the picture was printed a portion of the
      counter-question of Mr. Ayrton, and opposite to it were some verses with a
      jingling refrain that everyone could remember, and which everyone quoted
      during the next few days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The firm of publishers who had been fortunate enough to secure the issue
      of Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s new book were delighted. If Mr. Ayrton could only have
      seen his way to introduce their names and their address in his
      counter-question, their cup of happiness would have been complete, they
      said. They managed, however, to induce the proprietors of a young lady who
      was reputed to be the vulgarest and most fascinating of all music-hall
      artistes, to introduce Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s name into one of the movable
      stanzas of her most popular lyric: those stanzas which are changed from
      week to week, so as to touch upon the topics which are uppermost in the
      minds&mdash;well, not exactly the minds&mdash;of the public. It is
      scarcely necessary to say that this form of advertisement is worth columns
      of the daily papers; and if Mr. Courtland had only shown himself
      appreciative of his best interests and had changed the title of his book
      to &ldquo;The Land of the New Guinea Pig,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;The Quest of the
      Meteor-Bird,&rdquo; they would have gone to press with an extra thousand copies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even as it was they knew that between the member of Parliament and the
      music-hall young lady the sale of the book was a certainty. Their
      calculations were not at fault. The publishers sent a liberal subscription
      to the Nonconformist Eastern Mission, whose agents had stimulated public
      curiosity in Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s new book by suggesting that he had carried
      out, single-handed, one of the most atrocious massacres of recent years;
      and a diamond brooch to the music-hall young lady who had so kindly worked
      in the reference to the book after dancing one of her most daring
      hornpipes in the uniform of a midshipman; they doubled the lines of their
      announcements in the advertising columns of the paper that had issued the
      cartoon of the New Guinea Pig, and, finally, they sent a presentation copy
      of &ldquo;The Quest of the Meteor-Bird,&rdquo; to Mr. Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as everyone was humming the lines of the music-hall young lady:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    &ldquo;From the land of far New Guinea
     Came a little pig-a-ninny,&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      the daily papers were bound to give two-column reviews to the book on the
      day of its publication; and as the rod which Moses cast down before
      Pharaoh swallowed up the wriggling rods of the magicians, the interest
      attaching to Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s book absorbed that which attached to all the
      other books of the season, including &ldquo;Revised Versions,&rdquo; though the
      publishers of the latter moved heaven and earth (that is to say, the
      bishop and the people&rsquo;s churchwarden) to get the Rev. George Holland
      prosecuted. If either had been susceptible to reason, and had got up a
      case against their author, the publishers declared that Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s
      book would not have had a chance with &ldquo;Revised Versions.&rdquo; To be sure they
      admitted that the report that Mr. Holland had been thrown over by the lady
      who had promised to marry him had given a jerk forward to the sales; but
      when Mr. George Holland had been so idiotically blind to his best
      interests and (incidentally) the best interests of his publishers, as to
      contradict this suggestion of incipient martyrdom, and thus an excellent
      advertisement had been lost, and everyone was, in a week or two, talking
      about &ldquo;The Quest of the Meteor-Bird,&rdquo; while only a few continued shaking
      their heads over &ldquo;Revised Versions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, however, Mr. Courtland thought it well to call upon Mr. Ayrton
      in order to thank him for his kindness in replying in the House of Commons
      so effectively to the questions put to the various ministers by Mr.
      Apthomas; and Mr. Ayrton had asked Mr. Courtland to dinner, and Mr.
      Courtland had accepted the invitation, Miss Ayrton begging Mrs. Linton to
      be of the party, and Mrs. Linton yielding to her petition without demur.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WOULD IT BE WELL WITH MY HUSBAND?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was on their way back from this little dinner-party that Mr. Courtland
      confessed to Ella Linton that he had come to think of her dearest friend
      as a most charming and original girl; she had never once referred to his
      achievements in New Guinea, nor had she asked him to write his name in her
      birthday book. Yes, she was not as other girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so delighted to hear you say so much,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;Oh, Bertie! why
      not make yourself happy with a sweet girl such as she, and give no more
      thought to such absurdities as you have been indulging in? Believe me, you
      don&rsquo;t know so well as I do in what direction your happiness lies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about happiness,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to care
      much, either. When I made up my mind to find the meteor-bird, don&rsquo;t you
      suppose that there were many people who told me that, even if it was
      found, it was quite unlikely that it would be more succulent eating than a
      Dorking chicken? I&rsquo;m sure they were right. You see, I didn&rsquo;t go to New
      Guinea in search of a barndoor fowl. I don&rsquo;t want domestic happiness, I
      don&rsquo;t want anything but you&mdash;you are my meteor-bird. I found, after
      my first visit to New Guinea, that it was impossible for me to rest until
      I had found the meteor-bird. I have found that it is impossible for me to
      live without you, my beloved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to learn to live without me,&rdquo; said she, laying her hand
      upon his. They had now reached her house, so that no immediate reply was
      possible. He did not attempt to make a reply until they had gone into a
      small drawing room, and she had flung off her wrap. They were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he knelt on the rug before her and took both her hands in his own&mdash;a
      hand in each of his hands&mdash;as they lay on her dress. His face was
      close to hers: she was in a low chair. Each could hear the sound of the
      other&rsquo;s breathing&mdash;the sound of the other&rsquo;s heart-beats. That duet
      went on for some minutes&mdash;the most perfect music in life&mdash;the
      music which is life itself&mdash;the music by which man becomes immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not hold me any longer, Bertie,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Kiss me and go away&mdash;away.
      Oh, why should you ever come back? I believe that, if you loved me, you
      would go away and never come back. Oh, what is this farce that is being
      played between us? It is unworthy of either of us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A farce? A tragedy!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I want you, Ella. I told you that I could
      not live without you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want me? You want me, Bertie?&rdquo; said she. Tears were in her eyes and
      in her voice, for there was to her a passion of pathos in those words of
      his. &ldquo;You want me, and you know that it is only my soul that shall be lost
      if I give myself to you. God has decreed that only the soul of the woman
      pays the penalty of the man&rsquo;s longing for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You soul shall be saved, not lost,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;At present it is your soul
      that is in peril, when you give your sweetness to the man whom you have
      ceased to love&mdash;ah! whom you never loved. You will save your soul
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall lose it for all eternity,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Do you think that I
      complain? Do you fancy for a moment that I grumble at the decree of God,
      or that I rail against it as unjust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a woman, and therefore you know I will one day be ready to lose my
      soul for you, Bertie, my love. Oh, my dear, dear love, you say you want
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had sprung to his feet and was pacing the room before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say that you want me. Oh, my love, my love, do you fancy for a moment
      that your longing for me is anything to be compared to my longing for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My beloved, my beloved!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His arms were about her. His lips were upon hers. She kissed him as he
      kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she turned her head away so that his kisses fell upon her cheek
      instead of her mouth. She turned it still farther and they fell upon her
      neck&mdash;it was exquisite in its shape&mdash;and lay there like red
      rose-leaves clinging to a carved marble pillar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Wait; let me talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She untwined his arms from about her&mdash;the tears were still in her
      eyes as she tried to face him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you still have tears?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If anything stood between us
      and love, there might be room for tears, but nothing stands between us
      now. I am yours, you are mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the boast of a man who sees only the beginning of a love; mine
      are the tears of a woman who sees its end, and knows that it is not far
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can you say that? The end? the end of love such as ours? Oh, Ella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, listen to me, my love! I am ashamed of the part I have played during
      the past six months&mdash;since we were together on the Arno, and you are
      ashamed, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not ashamed. I have no reason to be ashamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you are not ashamed of the part you have played; but you are ashamed
      of me, Bertie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh you? I&mdash;ashamed of you? Oh, my darling, if you talk longer in
      that strain I will be ashamed of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are ashamed of me&mdash;I have sometimes felt it. A man with a heart
      such as I know yours to be, cannot but be ashamed of a woman, who, though
      the wife of another man, allows him to kiss her&mdash;yes, and who gives
      him kiss for kiss. Oh, go away&mdash;go away! I have had enough of your
      love&mdash;enough of your kisses, enough shame! Go away! I never wish to
      see you again&mdash;to kiss you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had walked to the other end of the room, and stood under a Venetian
      mirror&mdash;it shone like a monstrous jewel above her head&mdash;looking
      at him, her hands clenched, her eyes flashing through the tears that had
      not yet fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had no experience of women and their moods, and he was consequently
      amazed at her attitude. He took a step toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; she cried angrily. &ldquo;I will not have any more of you. I tell
      you that I have had enough. I find now that what I mistook for love was
      just the opposite. I believe that I hate you. No&mdash;no, Bertie, not
      that, it cannot be that, only&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I know now that it is not
      hate for you that I feel&mdash;it is hate for myself, hate for the
      creature who is hateful enough to stand between you and the happiness
      which you have earned by patience, by constancy, by self-control. Yes, I
      hate the creature who is idiotic enough to put honor between us, to put
      religion between us, to put her soul&rsquo;s salvation between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella, Ella, why will you not trust me?&rdquo; he said, when she had flung
      herself into a chair. He was standing over her with his hands clasped
      behind him. He was beginning to understand something of her nature; of the
      nature of the woman to whom love has come as a thief in the night. He was
      beginning to perceive that she had, in her ignorance, been ready to
      entertain love without knowing what was entailed by entertaining him. &ldquo;If
      you would only trust me, all would be well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She almost leaped from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Would all be well? Would it be well with my soul?
      Would it be well with both of us in the future? Would it be well with my
      husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know your husband,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know him, too,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He cares for me no more than I care for
      him, but he has never been otherwise than kind to me. I think of him&mdash;I
      think of him. I know the name that men give to the man who tries to make
      his friend&rsquo;s wife love him. It is not my husband who has earned that name,
      Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked into her face, but he spoke no word. Even he&mdash;the lover&mdash;was
      beginning to see, as in a glass, darkly, something of the conflict that
      was going on in the heart of the woman before him. She had uttered words
      against him, and they had stung him, and yet he had a feeling that, if he
      had put his arms about her again, she would have held him close to her as
      she had done before; she would have given him kiss for kiss as she had
      done before. It is the decree of nature that the lover shall think of
      himself only; but had he not told Phyllis that his belief was that Nature
      and Satan were the same? He was sometimes able to say, &ldquo;<i>Retro me,
      Sathana</i>&rdquo;&mdash;not always. He said it now, but not boldly, not loudly&mdash;in
      a whisper. The best way of putting Satan behind one is to run away from
      him. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Yes, but, on the whole,
      it is safer to show him a clean pair of heels than to enter on an argument
      with him, hoping that he will be amenable to logic. Herbert Courtland said
      his, &ldquo;<i>Retro me</i>,&rdquo; in a whisper, half hoping, as the gentlewoman with
      the muffins for sale hoped, that he would escape notice. For a few moments
      he ceased to think of himself. He thought of that beautiful thing before
      him&mdash;she was tall, and her rosy white flesh was as a peach that has
      reached its one hour of ripeness&mdash;he thought of her and pitied her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not the heart to put his arms about her, though he knew that to do
      so would be to give him all the happiness for which he longed. What was he
      that he should stand by and see that struggle tearing her heart asunder?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor child!&rdquo; said he, and then he repeated his words, &ldquo;My poor child!
      It would have been better if we had never come together. We are going to
      part now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and laughed in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what this meant. Had she been simply acting a part all
      along? Had she been playing a comedy part all the while he was thinking
      that a great tragedy was being enacted? Or was it possible that she was
      mocking him? that her laugh was the laugh of the jailer who hears a
      prisoner announce his intention of walking out of his cell?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fixed her eyes upon his face, then she laughed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now knew what she meant by her laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you may think that you have too firm a hold upon me to give me a
      chance of parting from you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You may be right; but if you tell
      me to go I shall try and obey you. But think what it means before you tell
      me to leave you forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did think what it meant. She looked at him, and she thought of his
      passing away from her forever more. She wondered what her life would be
      when he should have passed out of it. A blank? Oh, worse than a blank, for
      she would have ever present with her the recollection of how he had once
      stood before her as he was standing now&mdash;tall, with his brown hands
      clenched, and a paleness underlying the tan of his face. &ldquo;The bravest man
      alive&rdquo;&mdash;that was what Phyllis had called him, and Phyllis had been
      right. He was a man who had fought his way single-handed through such
      perils as made those who merely read about them throb with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the man of whom she knew that she would ever retain a memory&mdash;this
      was the man whom she was ready to send back to the uttermost ends of the
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was to be the reward of his devotion to her! What was she that
      she could do this thing? What was she that she should refrain from
      sacrificing herself for him? She had known women who had sacrificed
      themselves to men&mdash;such men! Wretched things! Not like that man of
      men who stood before her with such a look on his face as it had worn, she
      knew, in the most desperate moments of his life, when the next moment
      might bring death to him&mdash;death from an arrow&mdash;from a wild beast&mdash;from
      a hurricane.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could she do?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no effort to save herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had put his arms about her and had carried her away from her
      husband&rsquo;s house to the uttermost ends of the earth, she would not have
      resisted. It was not in her power to resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was because he saw this he went away, leaving her standing with
      that lovely Venetian mirror glittering in silver and ruby and emerald just
      above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been right; I have been wrong,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to speak,
      Ella. Don&rsquo;t try to keep me. I know how you love me, and I know that if I
      ask you to keep me you will keep me until you die. Forgive me for my
      selfishness, my beloved. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt him approach her and she felt the hands that he laid upon her
      bare shoulders&mdash;one on each side of her neck. She closed her eyes as
      he put his face down to hers and kissed her on the mouth&mdash;not with
      rapturous, passionate lips, but still with warm and trembling lips. She
      did not know where the kiss ended, she did not know when his hands were
      taken off her shoulders. She kept her eyes closed and her mouth sealed.
      She did not even give him a farewell kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she opened her eyes she found herself alone in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there came to her ears the sound of the double whistle for a
      hansom. She stood silently there listening to the driving up of the
      vehicle&mdash;she even heard the sound of the closing of the apron and
      then the tinkling of the horse&rsquo;s bells dwindling into the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sense of loneliness came to her that was overwhelming in its force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool! fool! fool!&rdquo; she cried, through her set teeth. &ldquo;What have I done?
      Sent him away? Sent him away? My beloved!&mdash;my best beloved&mdash;my
      man of men. Gone&mdash;gone! Oh, fool! fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She threw herself on a sofa and stared at the Watteau group of
      masquerading shepherds and shepherdesses on the great Sevres vase that
      stood on a pedestal near her. The masks at the joining of the handles were
      of grinning satyrs. They were leering at her, she thought. They alone were
      aware of the good reason there was for satyrs to grin. A woman had just
      sent away from her, forever, the bravest man in all the world&mdash;those
      were Phyllis&rsquo; words&mdash;a king of men&mdash;the one man who loved her
      and whom she loved. She had pretended to him that she was subject to the
      influences of religion, of honor, of duty! What hypocrisy! They knew it,
      those leering creatures&mdash;they knew that she cared nothing for
      religion, that she regarded honor and duty as words of no meaning when
      such words as love and devotion were in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the satyr masks, and had anyone been present in the room,
      that one would have seen that her lovely face became gradually distorted
      until the expression it wore was precisely the same as that upon the masks&mdash;an
      expression that had its audible equivalent in the laugh which broke from
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay back on her broad cushions. One of the strands of her splendid
      hair had become loose, and after coiling over half a yard of the brocaded
      silk of a cushion, twisted its way down to the floor. She lay back,
      pointing one finger at the face on the vase and laughing that satyr-laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know&mdash;we know&mdash;we know!&rdquo; she cried, and her voice was like
      that of a drunken woman. &ldquo;We know all&mdash;you and I&mdash;we know the
      hypocrisy&mdash;the pretense of religion&mdash;of honor&mdash;duty&mdash;a
      husband! Ah, a husband! that is the funniest of all&mdash;that husband! We
      know how little we care for them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She continued laughing until her cushion slipped from under her head. She
      half rose to straighten it, and at that instant she caught a glimpse of
      her face in the center silvered panel of the Venetian mirror. The cry of
      horror that broke from her at that instant seemed part of her laugh. It
      would not have occurred to anyone who might have heard it that it was
      otherwise than consistent with the incongruity, so to speak, of the
      existing elements of the scene. The hideous leer of the thing with horns,
      looking down at the exquisite picture of the <i>fete champetre</i>&mdash;the
      distorted features of the woman&rsquo;s face in the center of the ruby and
      emerald and sapphire of the Venetian mirror&mdash;the cry of horror mixed
      with the laugh of the woman who mocked at religion and honor and purity&mdash;all
      were consistently incongruous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another instant she was lying on the sofa with her face down to the
      cushion, trying to forget all that she had seen in the mirror. She wept
      her tears on the brocaded silk for half an hour, and then she slipped from
      where she was lying till her knees were on the floor. With a hand
      clutching each side of the cushion she got rid of her passion in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God! God! keep him away from me! keep him away from me!&rdquo; was her
      prayer; and it was possibly the best that she could have uttered. &ldquo;Keep
      him away from me! keep him away from me! Don&rsquo;t let my soul be lost! Keep
      him away from me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she struggled to her feet, at last, she stood in front of the mirror
      once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      She now saw a face purified of all passion by tears and prayer, where she
      had seen the soulless face of a Pagan&rsquo;s orgy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went upstairs to her bed and went asleep, thanking God that she had
      had the strength to send him away; that she had had strength sufficient to
      stand where she had stood in the room, silent, while he had put his arms
      on her bare shoulders and kissed her on the mouth, saying &ldquo;Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she had every reason to thank God for that strength, for she
      knew that it had been given to her at that moment; it had not sprung from
      within her own heart; her heart had been crying out to him, &ldquo;Stay, stay,
      stay!&rdquo; her heart took no account of honor or purity or a husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she felt that the strength which had come to her at that moment had
      been the especial gift of God, and she was thankful to God for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That consciousness of gratitude to God was her last sensation before
      falling asleep; and, when morning came, her first sensation was that of
      having a letter to write. Before she had breakfasted she had written her
      letter and sent it to be posted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY ONE LOVE: I was a fool&mdash;oh, such a fool! How could I have done
      it? How could I have sent you away in such coldness last night? Believe
      me, it was not I who did it. How could I have done it? You know that my
      love for you is limitless. You know that it is my life. I tell you that my
      love for you laughs at such limits as are laid down by religion and honor.
      Why should I protest? My love is love, and there can be no love where
      there are any limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me on Thursday. I shall be at home after dinner, at nine, and see
      if I am not now in my right mind. Come to me; come to me, Bertie, my
      love.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      WHAT AM I THAT I SHOULD DO THIS THING?
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat with the letter before him after he had breakfasted, and perhaps
      for a time, say a minute or so, he caught a glimpse of the nature of the
      woman who had written those lines to him. If he had not had some
      appreciation of her nature he would have spent an hour or two&mdash;perhaps
      a day or two&mdash;trying to reconcile her attitude of the previous night
      with the tone of her letter. He did not, however, waste his time over such
      an endeavor. He knew that she loved him, and that she did not love her
      husband. He knew that she had allowed him to kiss her, and it had been a
      puzzle to him for some months why she had not come to his arms forever&mdash;he
      meant her to be his own property forever. He had been amazed to hear her
      allude, as she had done on the previous night, to such abstractions as
      honor, religion, her husband. He could not see what they had to do with
      the matter in hand. He could not see why such considerations should be
      potent to exercise a restraining influence on the intentions of a man and
      a woman who love each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, now it would appear that she had cast to the winds all such
      considerations as she had enumerated, and was prepared to live under the
      rule of love alone, and it was at his suggestion she was doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment or two he saw her as she was: a woman in the midst of a
      seething ocean, throwing up her hands and finding an absolute relief in
      going down&mdash;down&mdash;down into very hell. For a moment or two his
      heart was full of pity for her. Who could be a spectator of a woman&rsquo;s
      struggles for life in the midst of that turbulent sea of passion which was
      overwhelming her, and refrain from feeling pity? That letter which lay
      before him represented the agonizing cry of a drowning creature; one whom
      the long struggle has made delirious; one who looks forward to going down
      with the delight born of delirium.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recollected a picture which he had once seen&mdash;the picture of a
      drowning woman. He saw it now before him with hideous vividness, and the
      face of the woman was the face of Ella Linton. The agony of that last
      fight with an element that was overpowering, overwhelming in its ruthless
      strength, was shown upon every feature, and his soul was filled with pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang to his feet and crushed the letter into his pocket. He felt none
      of the exultation of the huntsman&mdash;only sadness at the fate of the
      hunted thing that lay at his feet. Once before the same feeling had come
      over him. It was when, after the long struggle up the river, through the
      forests, swamps, jungle grass that cut the body of a man as though it were
      sharp wire, he fired his shot and the meteor-bird fell at his feet. After
      the first few panting breaths that came to him he had stood leaning on his
      gun, looking down at that beautiful thing which he had deprived of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I that I should have done this thing?&rdquo; he had asked himself on
      that evening, while the blacks had yelled around him like devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What am I that I should do this thing?&rdquo; was his cry now, as the voice of
      many demons sounded in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he that he should rejoice at receiving that letter from the woman
      over whose head the waters were closing?
    </p>
    <p>
      He ordered his horse and, mounting it, rode to where he could put it to
      the gallop. So men try to leave behind them the sneering demons of
      conscience and self-reproach. Some of them succeed in doing so, but find
      the pair waiting for them on their own doorstep. Herbert Courtland
      galloped his horse intermittently for an hour or two, and then rode
      leisurely back to his rooms. He felt that he had got the better of those
      two enemies of his who had been irritating him. He heard their voices no
      longer. He had lost them (he fancied), because there had come to him
      another voice that said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love her&mdash;I love her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And whensoever that voice comes to a man as it came to Herbert Courtland
      it drowns all other voices. He would love her to the end of his life.
      Their life together would be the real life for which men and women have
      come into the world. He would go to her, and so far from allowing her to
      sink beneath the waters down to hell, his arms would be around her to bear
      her up until&mdash;well, is it not generally conceded that love is heaven
      and heaven is love?
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself at a desk and wrote to her an impassioned line. He would
      go to her, he said. If death should come to him the next day he would
      still thank God for having given him an hour of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what he said&mdash;all. It expressed pretty well what he felt he
      should feel. That reference to God she would, of course, understand. God
      was to him a Figure of Speech. He had said as much to Phyllis Ayrton. But
      then he had said that he had regarded God to mean the Power by which men
      were able (sometimes) successfully to combat the influences of nature. But
      had he not just then made up his mind to yield to that passion which God,
      as a Principle, has the greatest difficulty in opposing? Why, then, should
      he expect that Ella would understand precisely what he meant in saying
      that he would thank God for his hour of life, his hour of love?
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have had considerable difficulty in explaining this apparent
      discrepancy between his scheme of philosophy and his life as a man, had
      Phyllis asked him to do so; and Phyllis would certainly have asked him to
      do so had she become acquainted with the contents of his letter to her
      friend Ella; though Phyllis&rsquo; father, having acquired some knowledge of men
      as well as of phrases, would not have asked for any explanation, knowing
      that a man&rsquo;s philosophy is, in its relation to a man&rsquo;s life, a good deal
      less important than the fuse is to a bomb. He would have known that a
      scheme of philosophy no more brings wisdom into a man&rsquo;s life than a
      telescope brings the moon nearer to the earth. He would have known that
      for a man to build up a doctrine of philosophy around himself, hoping that
      the devil will keep on the other side of the paling, is as ridiculous as
      it is to raise a stockade of roses against a tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Courtland, however, thought neither of philosophical consistency
      nor of the advantages of having on one&rsquo;s side a sound Principle. He
      thought of the stockade of roses, not to keep out the beast but to keep
      love in. They would live together in the midst of roses forever, and
      though each might possibly lose something by the transaction, yet what
      they might lose was nothing compared to what they should certainly win. Of
      that he was certain, and therefore he posted his impassioned line with a
      light heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was on Tuesday. He had still two days that he might employ thinking
      over the enterprise to which he was committed; and he certainly made the
      most of his time in this direction. Now and again, as he thought of what
      was in store for him&mdash;for her&mdash;he felt as if he were lifted off
      the earth, and at other times he felt that he was crushed into the earth&mdash;crushed
      into it until he had become incapable of any thought that was not of the
      earth, earthy. At such moments he felt inclined to walk down to the docks
      and step aboard the first vessel that was sailing eastward or westward or
      northward or southward. Then it was that he found but the scantiest
      comfort in the consideration of the loveliness of love. Glorifying life!
      No, corrupting life until life is more putrid than death.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what love was&mdash;something to fly from. But still he did not
      fly from the vision that came to him when he found himself alone after
      spending the evenings in brilliant company&mdash;a vision of the lovely
      woman who was waiting for him! What had she said? Her soul&mdash;her soul
      would be lost forevermore?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that showed that she was a woman, at any rate, and he loved her all
      the better for her womanliness. He knew very well that if God is a Figure
      of Speech with men, the losing of a soul is a figure of speech with women.
      The expression means only that they have lost the chance of drinking a
      number of cups of tea in drawing rooms whose doors are now shut to them.
      That was what Ella meant, no doubt. If she were openly to set at defiance
      certain of those laws by the aid of which society was kept together with a
      moderate degree of consistency, she would be treated as an outlaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, such a fate was not without its bright side. Some happiness may
      remain to human beings in that world which is on the hither side of London
      drawing rooms; and it would be his aim in life to see that she had all the
      happiness that the world could give her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pah! He felt his sentiment becoming a trifle brackish. He loved her, and
      she loved him. That was more than all the laws and the profits of society
      to them. That was the beginning and the end of the whole matter&mdash;the
      origin of the sin (people called it a sin) and the exculpation of the
      sinners. There was nothing more to be said or thought about the matter.
      Those who loved would understand. Those who did not understand would
      condemn, and the existence of either class was of no earthly importance to
      himself or to Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke on the Thursday morning the feeling of exultation of which
      he was conscious was not without a note of depression. So it had been when
      the object of his explorations in New Guinea had been attained, and he
      looked down at that exquisite thing&mdash;that dead splendor at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered if the attainment of every great object which a man may have
      in life brings about a feeling of sadness that almost neutralizes the
      exultation. As he picked up his letters he had a fear that among them
      there might be one from Ella, telling him that she had come to the
      conclusion that she had written too hastily those lines which he had
      received on Tuesday&mdash;that, on consideration, she was unwilling to
      lose her soul for love of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      No such letter, however, was among his correspondence. (Could it be
      possible that he was disappointed on account of this?) He received an
      intimation from Berlin of the conferring of an order upon him in
      recognition of his exploration of a territory in which Germany was so
      greatly interested. He received an intimation from Vienna that a gold
      medal had been voted to him by one of the learned societies in recognition
      of his contributions to biological science. He received an intimation from
      his publishers that they had just gone to press with another thousand (the
      twelfth) of his book, and he received thirteen cards of invitation to
      various functions to take place in from three to six weeks&rsquo; time, but no
      line did he receive from Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was his forever and ever, whether her soul would be lost or saved in
      consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rather thought that it would be lost; but that did not matter. She was
      his forever and ever.

      CHAPTER XVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HERBERT COURTLAND IS A MAN WHO HAS LIVED WITH HONOR.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a long day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward evening he recollected that he had to leave cards upon his host and
      hostess of the Monday previous, but it was past six o&rsquo;clock when he found
      himself at the top of the steps of Mr. Ayrton&rsquo;s house. Before his ring had
      been responded to a victoria drove up with Phyllis, and in a moment she
      was on the step beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked radiant in the costume which she was wearing. He thought he had
      never seen a lovelier girl&mdash;he was certain that he had never seen a
      better-dressed girl. (Mr. Courtland was not clever enough to know that it
      is only the beautiful girls who seem well dressed in the eyes of men.)
      There was a certain frankness in her face that made it very interesting&mdash;the
      frankness of a child who looks into the face of the world and wonders at
      its reticence. He felt her soft gray eyes resting upon his face, as she
      shook hands with him and begged him to go in and have tea with her. He
      felt strangely uneasy under her eyes this evening, and his self-possession
      failed him so far as to make it impossible for him to excuse himself. It
      did not occur to him to say that he could not drink tea with her on
      account of having an appointment which he could not break through without
      the most deplorable results. He felt himself led by her into one of her
      drawing rooms, and sitting with his back to the window while her frank
      eyes remained on his face, asking (so he thought) for the nearest approach
      to their frankness in response, that a man who has lived in the world of
      men dare offer to a maiden whose world is within herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I got the usual notification of the Order of the Bald Eagle,&rdquo;
       said he, in reply to her inquiry. &ldquo;I shall wear it next my heart until I
      die. The newspapers announced the honor that had been done to me the same
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot keep anything out of the papers,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if you want to&mdash;a condition which doesn&rsquo;t apply to my case,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;My publishers admitted to me last week that they wouldn&rsquo;t rest
      easy if any newspaper appeared during the next month without my name being
      in its columns in some place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure they were delighted at the development of the <i>Spiritual
      Aneroid&rsquo;s</i> attack upon you,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me I was a made man,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw back her head&mdash;it was her way&mdash;and laughed. Her
      laughter&mdash;all the grace of girlhood was in its ring; it was girlhood
      made audible&mdash;was lightening her fair face as she looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How funny!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You fight your way through the New Guinea
      forests; you are in daily peril of your life; you open up a new country,
      and yet you are not a made man until you are attacked by a wretched
      newspaper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the standpoint of the people who sell books, so you may depend
      upon its being the standpoint of the people who buy books,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can quite believe it,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Mr. Geraint, the novelist, took me
      down to dinner at Mrs. Lemuel&rsquo;s last night, and he told me that the only
      thing that will make people buy books is seeing the author&rsquo;s portrait in
      some of the illustrated papers, or hearing from some of the interviews
      which are published regarding him that he never could take sugar in his
      coffee. The reviews of his books are read only by his brother authors, and
      they never buy a book, Mr. Geraint says; but the interviews are read by
      the genuine buyers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Geraint knows his public, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy he does. He would be very amusing if he didn&rsquo;t aim so
      persistently at going one better than someone else in his anecdotes.
      People were talking at dinner about your having massacred the natives with
      dynamite&mdash;you did, you know, Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I have admitted so much long ago. There was no help for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course everyone was laughing when papa told how the massacre
      came about, and this annoyed Mr. Geraint and induced him to tell a story
      about a poor woman who fancied that melinite was a sort of food for
      children that caused their portraits to appear in the advertisements; so
      she bought a tin of it and gave it all to her little boy at one meal. It
      so happened, however, that he became restless during the night and fell
      out of his cradle. That happened a year ago, Mr. Geraint said, and yet the
      street isn&rsquo;t quite ready for traffic yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little anecdote of Mr. Geraint makes me feel very meek. If at any
      time I am tempted to think with pride upon my dynamite massacre, I shall
      remember Mr. Geraint&rsquo;s story, and hang my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were all amused at Mr. Geraint&rsquo;s lively imagination, but much more so
      when Mr. Topham, the under-secretary, shook his head gravely, and said in
      his most dignified manner, that he thought the reported occurrence&mdash;the
      melinite incident&mdash;quite improbable. He was going on to explain that
      the composition of the explosive differed so materially from that of the
      food that it would be almost impossible for any mother to take the one for
      the other, when our hostess rose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Topham must have been disappointed. As a demonstrator of the obvious
      he has probably no equal even among the under-secretaries. You discussed
      him pretty freely in the drawing room afterward, I may venture to
      suggest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we discussed you, Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A most unprofitable topic. From what standpoint&mdash;dynamite
      massacres?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the standpoint of heredity, of course. Can you imagine any topic
      being discussed in a drawing room, nowadays, from any other standpoint?
      There was a dear old lady present, Mrs. Haddon, and she said she had been
      a friend of your mother&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So she was; I recollect her very well. I should like to go see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told us a great deal about your mother, and your sister&mdash;a
      sister to whom you were greatly attached.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis&rsquo; voice had become low and serious; every tone suggested sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had such a sister,&rdquo; said he slowly. His eyes were not turned toward
      her. They were fixed upon a little model of St. Catherine of Siena,&mdash;a
      virgin among the clouds,&mdash;which was set in the panel of an old
      cabinet beside him. &ldquo;I had such a sister&mdash;Rosamund; she is dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Haddon told us so,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;She talked about your mother, and
      your sister, and of the influence which they had had upon your life&mdash;your
      career.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are both dead,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They did not live to see your triumph; that is what your tone suggests,&rdquo;
       said she. &ldquo;That is what Mrs. Haddon said&mdash;the tears were in her eyes&mdash;last
      night, Mr. Courtland. I wish you could have heard her. I wish you could
      have heard what she said when someone made a commonplace remark as to how
      sad it was they were dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say, Miss Ayrton?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said, &lsquo;No, no; please do not talk about death overtaking such as
      they. The mother, who transmits her nature to the son, renews her life in
      him; it is not he, but his mother, who lives.&rsquo; And then she asked, &lsquo;Do you
      suppose that Herbert Courtland ever sets out on any of his great
      enterprises without thinking of his mother and sister, without feeling
      that he must do something worthy of them, something for their sake? And
      you talk of them as if they were dead&mdash;as if they had passed away
      forever from the concerns of earth!&rsquo; That is what she said, Mr.
      Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had bent forward on his low seat, and was leaning his head on one of
      his hands. He had his eyes fixed on the parquet of the floor. He was
      motionless. He did not speak a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Haddon said something more,&rdquo; Phyllis continued, after a pause. Her
      voice had fallen still another tone. &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, as if musing, &lsquo;dead&mdash;dead!
      A man is as his mother has made him. He is with her from the moment she
      loves his father. She is evermore thinking of him; he is precious to her
      before the mystery of his birth is revealed to her. He grows up by her
      side, and loves her because he knows that she understands him. She does
      understand him, and she understands his father better by understanding her
      son.&rsquo; She said that, Mr. Courtland, and I felt that she had spoken one of
      the greatest truths of this mysterious life of ours. Then she said,
      &lsquo;Herbert Courtland is a man who has lived with honor to himself, with
      honor to the memory of his mother, and of his sister, whom he loved. He is
      a man, and he has not merely attained distinction in the world; if he is
      without fear, he is also without reproach; and ask him if he has not been
      strengthened in his fight with whatever of base may have risen up within
      him, being a man, from day to day, by the thought that his sister is one
      with him; that his purity of heart and of act is the purity of his mother
      and his sister, upon which no stain must ever come.&rsquo; That was all she
      said, Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause after she had spoken. He sat there with his head
      bent, his fingers interlaced. He had his eyes fixed upon the floor. His
      cup of tea stood untasted beside him on a little Algerian table.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she&mdash;as she looked at him her soft eyes became dim with tears.
      She knew that the words which she had spoken, the words which she had
      repeated as they were spoken by the lady whom she had met the previous
      night, had awakened many memories within him. She too had her memories.
      She knew that there was a certain gratefulness in the midst of the
      bitterness of such memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the tears continued to well up to her eyes until she was aware that he
      had risen from his seat and was standing in front of her. She drew her
      hand across her eyes. She saw a movement in his lips. They were trembling,
      but no sound came from them. The hand that he stretched out to her was
      trembling also. She put her own into it. He held her hand tightly for a
      moment, then dropped it suddenly and almost fled from the room, without
      uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few moments she stood where he had left her, and then she went to a
      sofa and seated herself upon it. The tears that had come to her eyes
      before, now began to fall; she thought, girl that she was, that she could
      understand what were the feelings of the man who had just parted from her.
      She thought that he was overcome at the reflection that the distinction
      which he had won in the world could not be shared by those whom he loved,
      those who would have valued far more than he did the honor that was being
      done to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pity of it! Oh, the pity of it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella had told her one day when they had talked together about Herbert
      Courtland, that he had no relation alive, that he stood alone in the
      world. The information had not meant much to her then; but when she had
      heard Mrs. Haddon speak on the previous evening about his attachment to
      his mother and his sister, she remembered what Ella has said, and her
      heart was full of pity for him. She had made up her mind to tell him all
      that Mrs. Haddon had said, for surely more sympathetic words had never
      been spoken; and her opportunity had come sooner than she expected. Their
      chat together had led naturally up to Mrs. Haddon, and she had been able
      to repeat to him almost word for word all that his mother&rsquo;s friend had
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart felt for him. Surely the sweetest reward that can come to a man
      who has toiled and fought and conquered was denied to the man who had just
      parted from her. He had toiled and conquered; but not for him was the joy
      of seeing pride on the face of those who claimed him as their kin. His
      father had been killed when he had charged with a brigade through the
      lines of a stubborn enemy&mdash;everyone knew the story. His mother and
      sister had died when he was beginning to make a name for himself. He had
      gone forth from the loneliness of his home to the loneliness of the
      tropical forest; and he had returned to the loneliness of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she had done well to repeat to him the words of his mother&rsquo;s
      friend. Those words had affected him deeply. They could not but be a
      source of comfort to him when he was overwhelmed with the thought of his
      loneliness. They would make him feel that his position was understood by
      some people who were able to think of him apart from the great work which
      he had accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the maiden sat musing in the silent room after she had dried her
      tears of pity for the man who an hour before had sauntered up to her door
      thinking, not of the melancholy isolation of his position in the world,
      but simply that two hours of the longest day of his life must pass before
      he could kiss the lips of the woman who had given herself up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her maid found her still seated on the sofa, and ventured to remind her
      that time was fugitive, and that if mademoiselle still retained her
      intention of going to Lady Earlscourt&rsquo;s dinner party,&mdash;Lady
      Earlscourt was giving a dinner party apparently for the purpose of
      celebrating her husband&rsquo;s departure for a cruise in Norwegian fjords in
      his yacht,&mdash;it would be absolutely necessary for mademoiselle to
      permit herself to be dressed without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis sprang up with a little laugh that sounded like a large sigh, and
      said if Fidele would have the kindness to switch on the lights in the
      dressing room, she would not be kept waiting a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid hurried upstairs, and mademoiselle repaired to an apartment where
      she could remove, so far as was possible, the footmarks left by those
      tears which she had shed when she had reflected upon the loneliness to
      which Mr. Herbert Courtland was doomed for (probably) the remainder of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle had a dread of the acuteness of vision with which her maid
      was endowed. She was not altogether sure that Fidele would be capable of
      understanding the emotion that had forced those tears to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was just where she was wrong. Fidele was capable of understanding
      that particular emotion a good deal better than mademoiselle understood
      it.

      CHAPTER XIX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THEY HAVE SOULS TO BE SAVED.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Lord Earlscourt was at home the only two topics that were debarred
      from the dinner table were religion and politics; but when Lord Earlscourt
      was absent these were the only two topics admitted at the dinner table.
      Lady Earlscourt had views, well-defined, clearly outlined, on both
      religion and politics, and she greatly regretted that there still remained
      some people in the world who held other views on both subjects; it was
      very sad&mdash;for them; and she felt that it was clearly her duty to
      endeavor by all the legitimate means in her power&mdash;say, dinner
      parties for eight&mdash;to reduce the number of these persons. It was
      rumored that in the country she had shown herself ready to effect her
      excellent object by illegitimate means&mdash;say, jelly and flannel
      petticoats&mdash;as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wore distinctly evangelical boots, though, in the absence of her
      husband, she had expressed her willingness to discuss the advantages of
      the confessional. She had, however, declined, in the presence of her
      husband, to entertain the dogma of infallibility: though she admitted that
      the cardinals were showy; she would have liked one about her house, say,
      as a footman. She thought there was a great deal in Buddhism (she had read
      &ldquo;The Light of Asia&rdquo; nearly through), and she believed that the Rev. George
      Holland had been badly treated by Phyllis Ayrton. She admitted having been
      young once&mdash;only once; but no one seemed to remember it against her,
      so she was obliged to talk about it herself, which she did with the
      lightness of a serious woman of thirty-two. When a man had assured her
      that she was still handsome, she had shaken her head deprecatingly, and
      had ignored his existence ever after. She had her doubts regarding the
      justice of eternal punishment for temporary lapses in the West End, but
      she sympathized with the missionary who said: &ldquo;Thank God we have still got
      our hell in the East End.&rdquo; She knew that all men are alike in the sight of
      Heaven, but she thought that the licensing justices should be more
      particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      She believed that there were some good men.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had more than once talked seriously to Phyllis on the subject of
      George Holland. Of course, George Holland had been indiscreet; the views
      expressed in his book had shocked his best friends, but think how famous
      that book had made him, in spite of the publication of Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Quest of the Meteor-Bird.&rdquo; Was Phyllis not acting unkindly, not to say
      indiscreetly, in throwing over a man who, it was rumored, was about to
      start a new religion? She herself, Lady Earlscourt admitted, had been very
      angry with George Holland for writing something that the newspapers found
      it to their advantage to abuse so heartily; and Lord Earlscourt, being a
      singularly sensitive man, had been greatly worried by the comments which
      had been passed upon his discrimination in intrusting to a clergyman who
      could bring himself to write &ldquo;Revised Versions&rdquo; a cure of such important
      souls as were to be found at St. Chad&rsquo;s. He had, in fact, been so harassed&mdash;he
      was a singularly sensitive man&mdash;that he had found it absolutely
      necessary to run across to Paris from time to time for a change of scene.
      (This was perfectly true. Lord Earlscourt had gone more than once to Paris
      for a change of scene, and had found it; Lady Earlscourt was thirty-two,
      and wore evangelical boots.) But, of course, since George Holland&rsquo;s
      enterprise had turned out so well socially, people who entertained could
      not be hard on him. There was the new religion to be counted upon. It was
      just as likely as not that he would actually start a new religion, and you
      can&rsquo;t be hard upon a man who starts a new religion. There was Buddha, for
      instance,&mdash;that was a long time ago, to be sure; but still there he
      was, the most important factor to be considered in attempting to solve the
      great question of the reconcilement of the religions of the East,&mdash;Buddha,
      and Wesley, and Edward Irving, and Confucius, and General Booth; if you
      took them all seriously where would you be?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, my dear Phyllis!&rdquo; continued Lady Earlscourt; &ldquo;you must not
      persist in your ill-treatment of Mr. Holland. If you do he may marry
      someone else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope he will, indeed,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;He certainly will never marry me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be obdurate,&rdquo; said Lady Earlscourt. &ldquo;He may not really believe in
      all that he put into that book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then there is no excuse for his publishing it,&rdquo; said Phyllis promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if he doesn&rsquo;t actually hold the views which he has formulated in that
      book, you cannot consistently reject him on the plea that he is not quite&mdash;well,
      not quite what you and I call orthodox.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This contention was too plain to be combated by the girl. She did not for
      a moment see her way out of the amazing logic of the lady. Quite a minute
      had passed before she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he propounds such views without having a firm conviction that they are
      true, he has acted a contemptible part, Lady Earlscourt. I think far too
      highly of him to entertain for a single moment the idea that he is not
      sincere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if you believe that he is sincere, why should you say that you will
      not marry him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not marry an atheist, however sincere he might be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An atheist! But Mr. Holland is not an atheist; on the contrary, he
      actually believes that there are two Gods; one worshiped of the Jews long
      ago, the other by us nowadays. An atheist! Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that I can&rsquo;t explain to you, dear Lady Earlscourt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Phyllis shook her head with some degree of sadness. She felt
      that it would indeed be impossible for her to explain to this lady of
      logic that she believed the truth to be a horizon line, and that any
      opinion which was a little above this line was as abhorrent as any that
      was a little below it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are stubborn, God may marry you to a Dissenter yet,&rdquo; said Lady
      Earlscourt solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis smiled and shook her head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t shake your head, my dear,&rdquo; resumed Lady Earlscourt. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      known of such judgments falling on girls before now&mdash;yes, when the
      Dissenters were well off. But no Dissenter rides straight to hounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More logic,&rdquo; she said, and shook hands with her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That girl has another man in her eye,&rdquo; said her friend sagaciously, when
      Phyllis had left her opposite her own tea-table. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t despair; if
      we can only persuade our bishop to prosecute George Holland, she may
      return to him all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She invariably referred to the bishop as if he were a member of the
      Earlscourt household; but it was understood that the bishop had never
      actually accepted the responsibilities incidental to such a position;
      though he had his views on the subject of Lady Earlscourt&rsquo;s cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interview had taken place a week before the dinner party for which
      Phyllis was carefully dressed by her maid Fidele while Herbert Courtland
      was walking away from the house. In spite of her logic, Lady Earlscourt
      now and again stumbled across the truth. When it occurred to her that
      Phyllis had another man in her eye,&mdash;the phrase was Lady Earlscourt&rsquo;s
      and it served very well to express her meaning,&mdash;she had made some
      careful inquiries on the subject of the girl&rsquo;s male visitors, and she had,
      of course, found out that no other man occupied that enviable position; no
      social oculist would be required to remove the element which, in Lady
      Earlscourt&rsquo;s estimation, caused Phyllis&rsquo; vision to be distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Holland was at the dinner. Phyllis had been asked very quietly by
      the hostess if she would mind being taken in by George Holland; if she had
      the least feeling on the matter, Sir Lionel Greatorex would not mind
      taking her instead of Mrs. Vernon-Brooke. But Phyllis had said that of
      course she would be delighted to sit beside Mr. Holland. Mr. Holland was
      one of her best friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is his case so hopeless as that?&rdquo; said Lady Earlscourt, in a low voice,
      and Phyllis smiled in response&mdash;the smile of the guest when the
      hostess had made a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lady Earlscourt had indiscreetly, but confidentially, explained to
      some of her guests the previous week that she meant her little dinner
      party to be the means of reuniting Mr. Holland and Miss Ayrton, one of
      them&mdash;he was a man&mdash;smiled and said, when she had gone away,
      that she was a singularly unobservant woman, or she would have known that
      the best way of bringing two people together is to keep them as much apart
      as possible. There was wisdom in the paradox, he declared; for everyone
      should know that it was only when a man and a woman were far apart that
      they came to appreciate each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed, indeed, that there was some truth in what that man said, for
      Phyllis, before the ice pudding appeared, had come to the conclusion that
      George Holland was a very uninteresting sort of man. To be sure, he had
      not talked about himself,&mdash;he was not such a fool as to do that: he
      had talked about her to the exclusion of almost every other topic&mdash;he
      had been wise enough to do that,&mdash;but in spite of all, he had not
      succeeded in arousing her interest. He had not succeeded in making her
      think of the present when her thoughts had been dwelling on the past&mdash;not
      the distant past, not the past of two months ago, when they had been
      lovers, but the past of two hours ago, when she had watched the effect of
      her words upon Herbert Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She chatted away to George Holland very pleasantly&mdash;as pleasantly as
      usual&mdash;so pleasantly as to cause some of her fellow-guests to smile
      and whisper significantly to one another, suggesting the impossibility of
      two persons who got on so well together as Mr. Holland and Miss Ayrton
      being separated by a barrier so paltry as an engagement broken off by the
      young woman for conscience&rsquo; sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the significant smiles of these persons were forced upon the
      notice of their hostess, she did not smile; she was a lady with a really
      remarkable lack of knowledge; but she knew better than to accept the
      pleasant chat of George Holland and Phyllis Ayrton as an indication that
      the <i>status quo ante bellum</i>&mdash;to make use of the expressive
      phrase of diplomacy&mdash;had been re-established between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only when George Holland ventured to express his admiration of Mr.
      Ayrton&rsquo;s adroitness in dealing with the foolish question of the gentleman
      from Wales did he succeed in interesting Miss Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a very foolish letter those missionaries sent home regarding the
      explorations of Mr. Courtland!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Did they hope to jeopardize the
      popularity of Mr. Courtland by suggesting that he had massacred a number
      of cannibals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that was their object,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They must be singularly foolish persons, even for missionaries,&rdquo; said the
      Rev. George Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even for missionaries?&rdquo; Phyllis repeated. &ldquo;Oh, I forgot that you are no
      believer in the advantages of missions to the people whom we call heathen.
      But I have not been able to bring myself to agree with you there. They
      have souls to be saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite likely,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But the methods of the missionaries,
      generally speaking, have not tended in that direction. Hence the
      missionary as a comestible is more highly esteemed by the natives than the
      missionary as a reformer. They rarely understand the natives themselves,
      and they nearly always fail to make themselves intelligible to the
      natives. It would appear that the two foolish persons who wrote that
      letter about Mr. Courtland made but a poor attempt at understanding even
      their own countrymen, if they fancied that any rumor of a massacre of
      cannibals&mdash;nay, any proof of such a massacre&mdash;would have an
      appreciable effect upon the popularity of the man who brought home the
      meteor-bird.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think that the public generally would believe the story?&rdquo; said
      Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it extremely unlikely that they would believe it,&rdquo; he replied.
      &ldquo;But even if they believed every word of it they would not cease to
      believe in Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s bravery. What is a hecatomb of cannibals
      compared to the discovery of the meteor-bird,&mdash;that is, in the eyes
      of the general public, or for that matter, the Nonconformist public who
      turn up their eyes at the suggestion of a massacre of natives of an island
      that is almost as unknown to them as Ireland itself? The people of this
      country of ours respect bravery more than any other virtue, and I&rsquo;m not
      altogether sure that they are generally astray in this matter. The
      Christian faith is founded upon bravery, and the same faith has inspired
      countless acts of brave men and women. Oh, no! Mr. Courtland will not
      suffer from the attacks of these foolish persons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him this&mdash;a short time ago,&rdquo; said Phyllis, &ldquo;and he told me
      that his publishers were delighted at the result of the agitation which
      that newspaper tried to get up against him: they said it was selling his
      book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw you talking with Mr. Courtland after the first production of
      &lsquo;Cagliostro.&rsquo; I envied you&mdash;and him,&rdquo; said Mr. Holland. &ldquo;I wonder if
      he was really placed in the unfortunate position of having to massacre a
      horde of cannibals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis laughed, and forthwith told him the truth as it had been
      communicated to her regarding the dynamite outrage upon the unsuspecting
      natives, and George Holland was greatly amused at the story&mdash;much
      more highly amused, it would have occurred to some persons, than a
      clergyman should be at such a recital. But then George Holland was not as
      other clergymen. He was quite devoid of the affectations of his cloth. He
      did not consider it necessary to put the tips of his fingers together and
      show more of the white portion of the pupil of his eye than a
      straight-forward gaze entailed, when people talked of the overflowing of a
      river in China and the consequent drowning of a quarter of a million of
      men&mdash;that is to say, Chinamen. He was no more affected by such
      tidings than the Emperor of China. He was infinitely more affected when he
      read of the cold-blooded massacre by David, sometime King of Israel, in
      order to purchase for himself a woman for whom he had conceived a liking.
      He knew that the majority of clergymen considered it to be their duty to
      preach funeral service over the drowned Chinamen, and to impress upon
      their hearers that David was a man after God&rsquo;s own heart. He also knew
      that the majority of clergymen preached annual sermons in aid of the
      missionaries who did some yachting in the South Seas, and had brought into
      existence the sin of nakedness among the natives, in order that they might
      be the more easily swindled by those Christians who sold them shoddy for
      calico, to purge them of their sin. George Holland could not see his way
      to follow the example of his brethren in this respect. He did not think
      that the Day of Judgment would witness the inauguration of any great
      scheme of eternal punishment for the heathen in his blindness who had been
      naked all his life without knowing it. He knew that the heathen in his
      blindness had curiosity enough at his command to inquire of the
      missionaries if the white beachcomber and his bottle of square-face
      represented the product of centuries of Christianity, and if they did not,
      why the missionaries did not evangelize the beachcomber and his bottle off
      the face of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis, being well aware of George Holland&rsquo;s views, was not shocked at
      the sound of his laughter at the true story of Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s dynamite
      outrage at New Guinea; but all the same, she was glad that she was not
      going to marry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not, however, been altogether uninteresting in her eyes while
      sitting beside her, and that was something to record in his favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drove home early, and running upstairs found herself face to face with
      Ella Linton.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I HAVE HEARD THE PASSIONATE GALLOP OF THOSE FIERY-FOOTED STEEDS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ella was standing waiting for her outside the open door of a drawing room.
      She was wearing a lovely evening dress with a corsage of white lace
      covered with diamonds and sapphires. Her hair&mdash;it was of the darkest
      brown and was very plentiful&mdash;was also glittering with gems under the
      light that flowed through the open door. The same light showed Phyllis how
      deathly white Ella&rsquo;s face and neck were&mdash;how tumultuously her bosom
      was heaving. She had one hand pressed to her side, and the other on the
      handle of the door when Phyllis met her; and in that attitude, even though
      the expanse of white flesh, with its gracious curves that forced out her
      bodice, had no roseate tint upon it, she looked lovely&mdash;intoxicating
      to the eyes of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis was certainly surprised. The hour was scarcely eleven, but Ella
      had given no notice of her intention to pay a visit to her friend that
      night. When the girl raised her hands with a laugh of admiration, of
      pleasure, Ella grasped her hands with both of her own and drew her into
      the drawing room without a word. Then with a cry,&mdash;a laugh and a cry
      mingled,&mdash;she literally flung herself into the girl&rsquo;s arms and kissed
      her convulsively a dozen times, on the throat, on the neck, on the
      shoulder whereon her head lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling, my darling!&rdquo; she cried,&mdash;and now and again her voice was
      broken with a sob,&mdash;&ldquo;my darling Phyllis! I have come to you&mdash;I
      want to be with you&mdash;to be near you&mdash;to keep my arms about you,
      so tightly that no one can pluck us asunder. Oh, you don&rsquo;t know what men
      are&mdash;they would pluck us asunder if they could; but they can&rsquo;t now.
      With you I am safe&mdash;that is why I have come to you, my Phyllis. I
      want to be safe&mdash;indeed I do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had now raised her head from Phyllis&rsquo; shoulder, but was still holding
      her tightly&mdash;a hand on each of her arms, and her face within an inch
      of the girl&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis kissed her softly on each cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what can have happened to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;nothing! I tell you that nothing has happened to me,&rdquo; cried
      Ella, with a vehemence that almost amounted to fierceness in her voice.
      &ldquo;Would I be here with you now if anything had happened to me? tell me
      that. I came to you&mdash;ah! women have no guardian angels, but they have
      sisters who are equally good and pure, and you are my sister&mdash;my
      sister&mdash;better than all the angels that ever sang a dirge over a lost
      soul that they put forth no hand to save. You will not let me go, darling
      Phyllis, you will not let me go even if I tell you that I want to go.
      Don&rsquo;t believe me, Phyllis; I don&rsquo;t want to go&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to be
      lost, and if I leave you I am lost. You will keep me, dear, will you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until the end of the world,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;Come, dearest Ella, tell me
      what is the matter&mdash;why you have come to me in that lovely costume.
      You look as if you were dressed for a bridal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bridal&mdash;a bridal? What do you mean by that?&rdquo; said Ella, with
      curious eagerness&mdash;a suggestion of suspicion was in her tone. She had
      loosed her hold upon the girl&rsquo;s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis laughed. She put a hand round Ella&rsquo;s waist and led her to a sofa,
      saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us sit down and talk it all over. That is the lace you told me you
      picked up at Munich. What a design&mdash;lilies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Virgin&rsquo;s flower&mdash;the Virgin&rsquo;s flower! I never thought of that,&rdquo;
       laughed Ella. &ldquo;It is for you&mdash;not me, this lace. I shall tear it off
      and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; cried Phyllis. &ldquo;I have heaps of lace&mdash;more
      than I shall ever wear. What a lovely idea that is of yours,&mdash;I&rsquo;m
      sure it is yours,&mdash;sewing the diamonds around the cup of the lilies,
      like dewdrops. I always did like diamonds on lace. Some people would have
      us believe that diamonds should only be worn with blue velvet. How
      commonplace! Where have you been to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have I been? I have been at home. Where should a good woman be in
      the absence of her husband, but at home&mdash;his home and her home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella laughed loud and long with her head thrown back on the cushion of the
      sofa, and the diamonds in her hair giving back flash for flash to the
      electric candles above her head. &ldquo;Yes; I was at home&mdash;I dined at
      home, and, God knows why, I conceived a sudden desire to go to the opera,&mdash;Melba
      is the <i>Juliet</i>,&mdash;and forgetting that you were engaged to the
      Earlscourts&mdash;you told me last week that you were going, but I
      stupidly forgot, I drove across here to ask you to be my companion. Oh,
      yes, I have been here since&mdash;since nine, mind that! nine&mdash;nine&mdash;ask
      the servants. When I heard that you were dining out I thought that I was
      lost&mdash;one cannot drive about the streets all night, can one? Ah! I
      thought that God was against me now, as he ever has been; and as for my
      guardian angel&mdash;ah! our guardian angels are worse than the servants
      of nowadays who have no sense of responsibility. Thompson, your butler, is
      worth a whole heavenful of angels, for it was he who asked me if I would
      come in and wait for your return&mdash;ask him, if you doubt my word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens, Ella, what do you say? Doubt your word&mdash;I doubt your
      word? You wound me deeply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, my Phyllis. I don&rsquo;t quite know what I said. Ah, let me nestle
      here&mdash;here.&rdquo; She had put her head down to Phyllis&rsquo; bare neck and was
      looking up to her face as a child might have done. &ldquo;There is no danger
      here. Now pet me, and say that you forgive me for having said whatever I
      did say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis laughed and put her lips down among the myriad diamonds that
      glowed amid the other&rsquo;s hair, like stars seen among the thick foliage of a
      copper beech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgive you for whatever you said,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I, too, have forgotten
      what it was; but you must never say so again. But had you really no
      engagement for to-night that you took that fancy for going to &lsquo;Romeo&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No engagement? Had I no engagement, do you ask me?&rdquo; cried Ella. &ldquo;Oh, yes,
      yes! I had an engagement, but I broke it&mdash;I broke it&mdash;I broke
      it, and that is why I am here. Whatever may come of it, I am here, and
      here I mean to stay. I am safe here. At home I am in danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis wondered greatly what had come to her friend to make her talk in
      this wild strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you engaged?&rdquo; she inquired casually. She had come to the
      conclusion that there was safety in the commonplace: she would not travel
      out of the region of commonplaces with Ella in her present state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where was I engaged? Surely I told you. Didn&rsquo;t I say something about the
      opera&mdash;&lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;?&mdash;that was to be the place, but I came
      to you instead. Ah, what have we missed! Was there ever such a poem
      written as &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;? Was there ever such music as Gounod&rsquo;s? I
      thought the first time that I went to the opera that it would spoil
      Shakspere&mdash;how could it do otherwise? I asked. Could supreme
      perfection be improved upon? Before the balcony scene had come to an end I
      found that I had never before understood the glory of the poem. Ah, if you
      could understand what love means, my Phyllis, you would appreciate the
      poem and the music; the note of doom runs through it; that&mdash;that is
      wherein its greatness lies&mdash;passion and doom&mdash;passion and doom&mdash;that
      is my own life&mdash;the life of us women. We live in a whirlwind of
      passion, and fancy that we can step out of the whirlwind into a calm at
      any moment. We marry our husbands and we fancy that all the tragedy of
      human passion is over so far as we are concerned. &lsquo;The haven entered and
      the tempest passed.&rsquo; Philip Marston&rsquo;s terrible poem,&mdash;you have read
      it,&mdash;&lsquo;A Christmas Vigil&rsquo;? &lsquo;The haven entered,&rsquo;&mdash;the whirlwind of
      passion has been left far away, we fancy. Oh, we are fools! It sweeps down
      upon us and then&mdash;doom&mdash;doom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My poor dear, you are talking wildly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you only understood&mdash;perhaps you will some day understand, and
      then you will know what seems wild in my speech is but the incoherence of
      a poor creature who has been beaten to the ground by the whirlwind, and
      only saved from destruction by a miracle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had sprung from her place on the sofa and was pacing the room, her
      diamonds quivering, luminous as a shower of meteors&mdash;that was the
      fancy that flashed from her to Phyllis. Meteors&mdash;meteors&mdash;what a
      splendid picture she made flashing from place to place! Meteors&mdash;ah,
      surely there was the meteor-bird flashing across the drawing room!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and sit down, my dear Ella,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;You are, as you know,
      quite unintelligible to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unintelligible to you? I am unintelligible to myself,&rdquo; cried Ella. &ldquo;Why
      should I be tramping up and down your room when I might be at this very
      moment&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She clutched Phyllis&rsquo; arm. &ldquo;I want to stay with you
      all night,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I want to sleep in your bed with you, Phyllis.
      I want to feel your arms around me as I used to feel my mother&rsquo;s long ago.
      Whatever I may say, you will not let me go, Phyllis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will load you with chains,&rdquo; said Phyllis, patting her lovely hair&mdash;it
      was no longer smooth. &ldquo;Why should you want to go away from me? Cannot we
      be happy together once again as we used to be long ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long ago that was! And we read &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; together, and
      fancied that we had gone down to the very depths of its meaning. We
      fancied that we had sounded the very depths of its passion and pathos. We
      were only girls. Ah, Phyllis, I tell you&mdash;I, who know&mdash;I, who
      have found it out,&mdash;I tell you that the tragedy is the tragedy of all
      lovers who have ever lived in the world. I tell you that it is the tragedy
      of love itself. &lsquo;Gallop apace, ye fiery-footed steeds!&rsquo; That is the poem
      that the heart of the lover sings all day&mdash;all day! I have heard it&mdash;my
      heart has sung it. I have heard the passionate gallop of those
      fiery-footed steeds. I have listened to them while my heart beat in unison
      with their frantic career&mdash;all day counting the moments with fiery
      face, and then&mdash;then&mdash;something that was not passion forced me
      to fly from it for the salvation of my soul. I was a fool! Why am I here,
      when I should be where he&mdash;&mdash;What is the hour? Why, it is
      scarcely twelve o&rsquo;clock! Did I say nine in my letter? What does it matter?
      I wonder if on that wonderful night&mdash;Gounod translated its glory into
      music&mdash;Juliet kept her lover waiting for three hours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; cried Phyllis, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella had picked up her theatre wrap&mdash;it was a summer cloud brocaded
      with golden threads of quivering sunlight, and had flung it around her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held out a hand to Phyllis. Phyllis grasped her round the waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had whispered the words, and at their utterance Phyllis gave a cry of
      horror and covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she seen a suggestion of the satyr in the expression of that lovely
      face before her?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pause that followed the sound of footsteps upon the stairs outside
      was heard; the sound of footsteps and of men&rsquo;s friendly laughter. Some
      persons were in the act of ascending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; whispered Ella. &ldquo;He has followed me here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;Papa is bringing someone to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom&mdash;whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were both standing together in the middle of the room, both having
      their eyes fixed on the door, when the door opened and Mr. Ayrton
      appeared, having by his side a man with iron-gray hair and a curiously
      pallid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sight of that man Ella&rsquo;s hands, that had been holding her wrap
      close to her throat, feeling for its silver clasp, fell limp, and the
      splendid mass of white brocade slipped to the floor and lay in folds about
      her feet, revealing her lovely figure sparkling from the hem of her dress
      to the top of her shapely head.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THAT TOILET SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WASTED.
    </h3>
    <p>
      For several seconds the tableau remained unchanged: the two women standing
      side by side, the two men motionless at the half-open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella was staring at the man who had entered with Mr. Ayrton. There was
      some apprehension in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had his eyes fixed upon her. But his face was wholly devoid of
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis was the first to break the silence that made a frame, so to speak,
      for the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Linton?&rdquo; she said, taking a step toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very well, thank you, Miss Ayrton,&rdquo; the man replied, shaking hands
      with her. &ldquo;Rather a singular hour for a visit, is it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! only Ella didn&rsquo;t tell me that you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned to Ella, and noticed that the expression of apprehension on her
      face had increased. She was still gazing at her husband as one shut up in
      a room with a snake might gaze at it, waiting for it to strike.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella didn&rsquo;t tell you that I was coming?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;She had the best of
      reasons for her reticence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sound came from Ella. There was a little scornful smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best of reasons?&rdquo; said Phyllis interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best; she had no idea that I was coming. I wonder if she is glad
      to see me. She has not spoken a word to me yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have startled her by your sudden appearance,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;She is
      not certain whether you are flesh and blood or a ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Ella gave a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He is my husband. Go on with what you have to say,
      Stephen. I will not run away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run away? What nonsense is this, my dear? Run away? Who said anything
      about your running away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband had advanced to her as he spoke. He put a hand caressingly on
      one of her bare arms and the other at the back of her head. She suffered
      him to press her head forward until he put his lips upon her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had released her, and had taken a step back from her,&mdash;he
      seemed abut to address Phyllis,&mdash;a little cry forced itself from her.
      She called his name twice,&mdash;the second time louder,&mdash;and threw
      herself into his arms, burying her face on his shoulder, as she had buried
      it on Phyllis&rsquo; shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments, however, she looked up. Her husband was patting her on
      the arm. She had acquired two new gems since she had bent her head. They
      were shining in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away, Phyllis dear,&rdquo; she said. Phyllis and her father were
      standing at the <i>portiere</i> between the drawing rooms. Mr. Ayrton had
      a hand at the embroidered edge in the act of raising it. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away. I
      am all right now. I was quite dazed at Stephen&rsquo;s sudden appearance. I
      thought that perhaps he had&mdash;had&mdash;&mdash;Ah, I scarcely know
      what I thought. How did you come here&mdash;why did you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had turned to her husband. In spite of her manifestation of affection,&mdash;the
      result of a certain relief which she experienced at that moment,&mdash;there
      was a note of something akin to indignation in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very simple, my dear,&rdquo; replied her husband. His curiously sallow
      face had resumed its usual expressionless appearance. &ldquo;Nothing could be
      more simple. I got a telegram at Paris regarding the mine, and I had to
      start at a moment&rsquo;s notice. I wrote out a telegram to send to you, and
      that idiotic courier put it into the pocket of my overcoat instead of
      sending it. I found it in my pocket when we had come as far as Canterbury.
      I am not one of those foolish husbands who keep these pleasant surprises
      for their wives&mdash;it is usually the husband who receives the surprise
      in such cases.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the coachman told you that he had driven me here?&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; replied the husband. &ldquo;But, you see, I had some little
      hesitation in coming here at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock to make inquiries about
      my wife&mdash;you might have gone to some place else, you know, in which
      case I should have looked a trifle foolish; so I though that, on the
      whole, my best plan would be to drop in upon Mr. Ayrton at the House of
      Commons and drive here with him when he was coming home for the night. I
      took it for granted that even so earnest a legislator as Mr. Ayrton allows
      himself his nights&mdash;after twelve, of course&mdash;at home. I&rsquo;m very
      sorry I startled you, Ella. It shall not occur again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time did you reach home?&rdquo; inquired Ella casually&mdash;so casually
      that her husband, who had a very discriminating ear, gave a little glance
      in her direction. She was disengaging a corner of her lace trimming that
      had become entangled with a large sapphire in a pendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reached home at nine,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At nine?&rdquo; She spoke the words after him in a little gasp. Then she said,
      walking across the room to a sofa, &ldquo;I could not have left many minutes
      before you arrived. I intended going to the opera.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That toilet should not have been wasted,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It is exquisite&mdash;<i>ravissante</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an inspiration, your putting it on,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;I wonder if
      she really had no subtle suggestion from her own heart that you were on
      your way to her, Mr. Linton,&rdquo; she added, turning to the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it was some inward prompting of that mysterious nature, Miss
      Ayrton,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;A woman&rsquo;s heart is barometric in its nature, it is
      not? Its sensitiveness is so great that it moves responsive to a
      suggestion of what is to come. Is a woman&rsquo;s heart prophetic, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a rank heresy to doubt it, after the example we have had
      to-night,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton. &ldquo;Yes, a woman&rsquo;s heart is a barometer
      suggesting what is coming to her, and her toilet is a thermometer
      indicating the degree of expectancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A charming phrase,&rdquo; said Mr. Linton; &ldquo;a charming principle, only one that
      demands some years of close study to be rendered practical. For instance,
      look at my wife&rsquo;s toilet: it is bridal, and yet we have been married three
      years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so; and that toilet means that you are the luckiest fellow in the
      world,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I admit the interpretation,&rdquo; said her husband. &ldquo;I told the hansom to wait
      for me. He is at the door now. You have had no opera to-night, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would not expect me to go alone? Phyllis was dining at the
      Earlscourts&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the soul of discretion, my beloved,&rdquo; said the husband. &ldquo;Is your
      stock of phrases equal to a suggestion as to what instrument is the soul
      of a woman, Ayrton?&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Her heart is a barometer, her toilet a
      thermometer, and her soul&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The soul of a woman is not an instrument, but a flower&mdash;a lily,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And my wife wears her soul upon her sleeve,&rdquo; said Mr. Linton, touching
      the design on the lace that fell from her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not for daws to peck at&mdash;that is the heart,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Ayrton.
      &ldquo;Talking of woman&rsquo;s soul, how is Lady Earlscourt?&rdquo; he added, to his
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so sorry that I was at that stupid dinner,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;I might
      have enjoyed the music of &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet.&rsquo; But I had engaged myself to
      Lady Earlscourt a fortnight ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did not see Lord Earlscourt, at any rate,&rdquo; said her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he left us in the evening for Southampton,&rdquo; said Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, curiously enough, I dined with him at the club,&rdquo; said her father.
      &ldquo;Yes, he came in with Herbert Courtland at half-past seven; he had met
      Courtland and persuaded him to join him in his cruise to Norway. They
      dined at my table, and by the time we had finished Courtland&rsquo;s man had
      arrived with his bag. He had sent the man a message from the club to pack.
      They left by the eight-forty train, and I expect they are well under way
      by this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite too bad of Courtland,&rdquo; said Mr. Linton. &ldquo;I wanted to have a
      talk with him&mdash;a rather serious talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella had listened to Mr. Ayrton&rsquo;s account of that little dinner party at
      the club with white cheeks&mdash;a moment before they had been red&mdash;and
      with her lips tightly closed. Her hands were clenched until the tips of
      the nails were biting into each of her palms, before he had come to the
      end of his story&mdash;a story of one incident. But when her husband had
      spoken her hands relaxed. The blaze that had come to her eyes for a second
      went out without a flicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A serious talk?&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A serious talk&mdash;about the mine,&rdquo; replied her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the mine,&rdquo; she repeated, and a moment after burst into a laugh that
      was almost startling in its insincerity. &ldquo;It is so amusing, this chapter
      of cross-purposes,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What a sight it has been! a night of
      thrilling surprises to all of us! I miss Phyllis by half an hour and my
      husband misses me by less than half an hour. He comes at express speed
      from Paris to have a talk, a serious talk, with Mr. Courtland about the
      mine, and while he is driving from Victoria, Mr. Courtland is driving to
      the same station with Lord Earlscourt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a series of fatalities!&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton. &ldquo;But what seemed to me
      most amusing was the persuasiveness of Earlscourt. He has only to speak
      half a dozen words to Courtland, and off he goes to Norway at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice with probably the most uncongenial boat&rsquo;s load that Courtland ever
      sailed with, and he must have done a good deal in that way in New Guinea
      waters. Now, why should Courtland take such a turn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, why, indeed!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Linton. &ldquo;Yes, that is, as you say, the most
      amusing part of the whole evening of cross-purposes. Why should he run
      away just at this time&mdash;to-night&mdash;to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there particular about to-night that Courtland&rsquo;s running away
      should seem doubly erratic?&rdquo; asked Mr. Linton, after a little pause. He
      had his eyes fixed coldly upon his wife&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to him and laughed quite merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is there particular about to-night?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Why, have you
      not arrived from Paris to-night to have that serious talk with him about
      the mine? Doesn&rsquo;t it seem to you doubly provoking that he didn&rsquo;t stay
      until to-morrow or that you didn&rsquo;t arrive yesterday? Why, why, why did he
      run away to-night before nine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why before nine?&rdquo; said her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! Was not that the hour when you arrived home? You said so just
      now,&rdquo; she cried. Then she picked up her wrap. Phyllis had thrown it over a
      chair when it had lain in a heap on the floor as Cleopatra&rsquo;s wrap may have
      lain when she was carried into the presence of her lover. &ldquo;My dear
      Stephen, don&rsquo;t you think that as it is past nine, and Mr. Courtland is
      probably some miles out at sea with his head reposing on something hard,&mdash;there
      is nothing soft about a yacht,&mdash;we should make a move in the
      direction of home? It seems pretty clear that you will have no serious
      talk with him to-night. Alas! my Phyllis, our dream of happiness is over.
      We are to be separated by the cruelty of man, as usual. Good-night, my
      dear! Good-night, Mr. Ayrton! Pray forgive us for keeping you out of bed
      so long; and receive my thanks for restoring my long-lost husband to my
      arms. Didn&rsquo;t you say that the hansom was waiting, Stephen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect the man has been asleep for the last half-hour,&rdquo; said her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope nothing has gone astray with the gold mine,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t
      someone made a calculation regarding the accumulation of a shilling hansom
      fare at compound interest when the driver is kept waiting? It is like the
      sum about the nails in the horse&rsquo;s shoe. We shall be ruined if we remain
      here much longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton, when he had kissed her hand, and
      straightened the sable collar of her wrap; &ldquo;ah, my dear, a husband is a
      husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even when he stays away from his wife for three months at a time?&rdquo; said
      Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in spite of that, but on account of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton. &ldquo;Have you
      been married all these years without finding that out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; said she.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      HE HAD EXPLAINED TO PHYLLIS ONCE THAT HE THOUGHT OF GOD ONLY AS A
      PRINCIPLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the hansom wheels died away before the father and daughter
      exchanged a word. Mr. Ayrton was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems to have been a night of mischance,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad that Mr. Linton has returned,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Now, why should you be glad of that very ordinary incident?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Oh, papa, I am so fond of her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She may be fond of him, after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton spoke musingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she is,&rdquo; said Phyllis, with a positiveness that was designed to
      convince herself that she believed her own statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he may be fond of her&mdash;yes, at times,&rdquo; resumed Mr. Ayrton. &ldquo;That
      toilet of hers seems to have been the only happy element in the game of
      cross-purposes which was played to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; whispered the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it was in inspiration. She could not have expected her husband
      to-night. What a dress! Even a husband would be compelled to admit its
      fascination. And she said she meant to wear it at the opera to-night. It
      was scarcely an opera toilet, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella&rsquo;s taste is never at fault, papa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose not. I wonder if he is capable of appreciating the&mdash;the&mdash;let
      us say, the inspiration of that toilet. Is that, I wonder, the sort of
      dress that a man likes his wife to wear when she welcomes him home after
      an absence of some months? No matter it was exquisite in every detail.
      Curious, her coming here and waiting after she had learned that you were
      out, was it not; from nine o&rsquo;clock&mdash;that fateful hour!&mdash;to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think she must have felt&mdash;lonely,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;She seemed so
      glad to see me&mdash;so relieved. She meant to stay with me all night,
      poor thing! Oh, why should her husband stay away from her for months at a
      time? It is quite disgraceful!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that we had better go to bed,&rdquo; said her father. &ldquo;If we begin to
      discuss abstract questions of temperament we may abandon all hope of sleep
      tonight. We might as well try to fathom Herbert Courtland&rsquo;s reasons for
      going to yacht with so uncongenial a party as Lord Earlscourt&rsquo;s.
      Good-night, my dear!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her and went upstairs. She did not follow him immediately. She
      stood in the center of the room, and over her sweet face a puzzled
      expression crept, as a single breath of wind passes over the smooth
      surface of a lake on a day when no wind stirs a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thought first of Herbert Courtland, which of itself was a curious
      incident. How did it come that he had yielded so easily to the invitation
      of Lord Earlscourt to accompany him on his cruise in the yacht <i>Water
      Nymph</i>? (Lord Earlscourt&rsquo;s imagination in the direction of the
      nomenclature of his boats as well as his horses was not unlimited.)
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was just the question which her father had suggested as an
      example of a subject of profitless discussion. She remembered this, and
      asked herself if it was likely that she, having at her command fewer data
      than her father bearing upon this case, should make a better attempt than
      he made at its solution. Her father had seen Herbert Courtland since he
      had agreed to go on the cruise, and was therefore in the better position
      to arrive at a reasonable conclusion in regard to the source of the
      impulse upon which Mr. Courtland had acted; so much she thought certain.
      And yet her father had suggested the profitless nature of such an
      investigation, and her father was certainly right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only for a single moment did it occur to her that something she had said
      to Herbert Courtland when he was sitting there, there in that chair beside
      her, might have had its influence upon him&mdash;only for a single moment,
      however; then she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, no! that supposition was too, too ridiculous to be entertained for a
      moment. He had, to be sure, shown that he felt deeply the words which she
      had quoted as they came from Mrs. Haddon; but what could those words have
      to do with his sudden acceptance of Lord Earlscourt&rsquo;s invitation to go to
      Norway?
    </p>
    <p>
      She made up her mind that it was nothing to her what course Herbert
      Courtland had pursued, consequently the endeavors to fathom his reason for
      adopting such a course would be wholly profitless. But the question of the
      singular moods suggested by the conduct and the words of her friend Ella
      Linton stood on a very different basis. Ella was her dearest friend, and
      nothing that she had said or done should be dismissed as profitless.
    </p>
    <p>
      What on earth had Ella meant by appearing in that wonderful costume that
      night? It was not a toilet for the opera, even on a Melba night; even on a
      &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; night, unless, indeed, the wearer meant to appear on
      the stage as <i>Juliet</i>, was the thought which occurred to the girl.
      Her fantastic thought&mdash;she thought it was a fantastic thought&mdash;made
      her smile. Unless&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then another thought came to her which, not being fantastic, banished
      her smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Unless</i>&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      She got to her feet&mdash;very slowly&mdash;and walked very slowly&mdash;across
      the room. She seated herself on the sofa where Ella had sat, and she
      remained motionless for some minutes. Then she made a motion with one of
      her hands as if sweeping from before her eyes some flimsy repulsiveness&mdash;the
      web of an unclean thing flashing in the air. In another instant she had
      buried her face in the pillow that still bore the impress of Ella&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God&mdash;my God, forgive me&mdash;forgive me&mdash;forgive me!&rdquo; was
      her silent, passionate prayer as she lay there sobbing. &ldquo;How could I ever
      have such a thought, so terrible a thought. She is my friend&mdash;my
      sister&mdash;and she put herself into her husband&rsquo;s arms and kissed him!
      Oh, God, forgive me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was her prayer for the greater part of the night as she lay in her
      white bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that she had sinned grievously in thought against her friend,
      when she recalled the way in which her friend had thrown herself into the
      arms of her husband. That was the one action which the girl felt should
      entitle Ella Linton to be the subject of no such horrid thought as had
      been for a shocking instant forced upon her mind, when she reflected upon
      the strange passion which had tingled through Ella&rsquo;s repetition of the
      fiery words of <i>Juliet</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recalled every strange element in the incident of Ella&rsquo;s appearance in
      the drawing room: the way in which Ella had kissed her and clung to her as
      a child might have done on finding someone to protect it; she recalled the
      wild words which Ella had uttered, and, finally, the terrible expression
      which had appeared on her face as she whispered that reckless answer to
      Phyllis&rsquo; question, when she had picked up her wrap and flung it around her
      just before the sound of footsteps had come to their ears. All that she
      recalled in connection with that extraordinary visit of Ella&rsquo;s was quite
      intelligible to her; but the mystery of all was more than neutralized by
      her recollection of the way Ella had thrown herself into her husband&rsquo;s
      arms. That action should, she felt, be regarded as the one important
      factor, as it were, in the solution of the problem of Ella&rsquo;s mood&mdash;Ella&rsquo;s
      series of moods. Nothing else that she had done, nothing that she had
      said, was worthy of being taken account of, alongside that dominant act of
      the true wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little whisper which suggested to her that there was a good deal that
      was mysterious in the incident of her friend&rsquo;s visit she refused to regard
      as rendering it less obligatory on her&mdash;Phyllis&mdash;to pray that
      she might be forgiven that horrid suspicion which, for an instant, had
      come to her; and so she fell asleep praying to God to forgive her for her
      sin (in thought) against her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      And while Phyllis was praying her prayer, her friend, the True Wife, was
      praying with her face down upon her pillow, and her bare arms stretched
      out over the white lace of the bed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, O God; forgive me! and keep him away from me&mdash;forever
      and ever and ever. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while both these prayers were being prayed, Herbert Courtland was
      sitting on one of the deck stools of the yacht <i>Water Nymph</i>, looking
      back at the many lights that gleamed in clusters along the southern coast
      of England, now far astern; for a light breeze was sending the boat along
      with a creaming, quivering wake. In the bows a youth was making the night
      hideous through the agency of a banjo and a sham negro melody. Amidships,
      Lord Earlscourt and two other men were playing, by the light of a lantern
      slung from the backstay, a game called poker; Lord Earlscourt, at every
      fresh deal, trying to make the rest understand how greatly the worry of
      being held responsible, as the patron of the living of St. Chad&rsquo;s, for the
      eccentricities of his rector, had affected his nerves&mdash;a matter upon
      which his friends assured him, with varied degrees of emphasis, they were
      in no way interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a few feet of these congenial shipmates Herbert Courtland sat
      looking across the shining ripples to the shining lights of the coast;
      wondering how he came to be on the sea instead of on the shore. Was this
      indeed the night over which his imagination had gloated for months? Was it
      indeed possible that this was the very night following the day&mdash;Thursday&mdash;for
      which he had engaged himself in accordance with the letter that he still
      carried in his pocket?
    </p>
    <p>
      How on earth did it come that he was sitting with his arm over the
      bulwarks of a yacht instead of&mdash;&mdash;Oh, the thing was a miracle&mdash;a
      miracle! He could think of it in no other light than that of a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, if it were a miracle, it had been the work of God, and God had to be
      thanked for it. He had explained to Phyllis once that he thought of God
      only as a Principle&mdash;as the Principle which worked in opposition to
      the principle of nature. That was certainly the God which had been evolved
      out of modern civilization. The pagan gods had been just the opposite.
      They had been founded on natural principles. The Hebrew tradition that God
      had made man in his own image was the reverse of the scheme of the pagan
      man who had made God after his own image; in the image of man created he
      God.
    </p>
    <p>
      But holding the theory that he held&mdash;that God was the sometimes
      successful opponent to the principles of nature (which he called the
      Devil)&mdash;Herbert Courtland felt that this was the very God to whom his
      thanks were due for the miracle that had been performed on his behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God&mdash;thank God&mdash;thank God!&rdquo; he murmured, looking out over
      the rippling waters, steel gray in the soft shadow of the summer&rsquo;s night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then he held that &ldquo;thank God&rdquo; was but a figure of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tinky-tink, tinky-tink, tinky-tinky-tinky-tinky-tinky-tinky-tink,&rdquo; went
      the youth with the banjo in the bows.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ITS MOUTHINGS OF THE PAST HAD BECOME ITS MUMBLINGS OF THE PRESENT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was very distressing&mdash;very disappointing! The bishop would neither
      institute proceedings against the rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s nor state plainly
      if it was his intention to proceed against that clergyman. When some
      people suggested very delicately&mdash;the way ordinary people would
      suggest anything to a bishop&mdash;that it was surely not in sympathy with
      the organization of the Church for any clergyman to take advantage of his
      position and his pulpit to cast sometimes ridicule, sometimes abuse, upon
      certain &ldquo;scriptural characters&rdquo;&mdash;that was their phrase&mdash;who had
      hitherto always been regarded as sacred, comparatively sacred, the bishop
      had brought the tips of the fingers of one hand in immediate, or almost
      immediate, contact with the tips of the fingers of his other hand, and had
      shaken his head&mdash;mournfully, sadly. These signs of acquiescence,
      trifling though they were, had encouraged the deputation that once waited
      on his lordship&mdash;two military men (retired on the age clause), an
      officer of engineers (on the active list), a solicitor (retired), and a
      member of the London County Council (by occupation an ironmonger), to
      express the direct opinion that the scandal which had been created by the
      dissemination&mdash;the unrebuked dissemination&mdash;of the doctrines
      held by the rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s was affording the friends of
      Disestablishment an additional argument in favor of their policy of
      spoliation. At this statement his lordship had nodded his head three times
      with a gravity that deeply impressed the spokesman of the deputation. He
      wondered if his lordship had ever before heard that phrase about the
      furnishing of an additional argument to the friends of Disestablishment.
      (As a matter of fact his lordship had heard it before.)
    </p>
    <p>
      After an expression of the deputation&rsquo;s opinion that immediate steps
      should be taken to make the rector of St. Chad&rsquo;s amenable to the laws of
      the Church,
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      (It was his facility in making conciliatory replies that had brought about
      his elevation in the Church):
    </p>
    <p>
      He referred to (1) his deep appreciation of the sincerity of the
      deputation; (2) his own sense of responsibility in regard to the feelings
      of the weaker brethren; (3) his appreciation of the value of the counsel
      of practical men in many affairs of the Church; (4) the existing position
      of the Church in regard to the laity; (5) the friendly relations that had
      always existed between himself personally and the clergy of his extensive
      diocese; (6) his earnest and prayerful desire that these relations might
      be strengthened; (7) the insecurity of a house divided against itself; (8)
      the progress of socialism; (9) the impossibility of socialism commending
      itself to Englishmen; (10) the recent anarchist outrages; (11) the purity
      of the Court of her Majesty the Queen; (12) the union of all Christian
      Churches; (13) the impossibility of such union ever becoming permanent;
      (14) the value of Holy Scripture in daily life; (15) his firm belief in
      the achievement of England&rsquo;s greatness by means of the open Bible; (16)
      the note of pessimism in modern life; (17) the necessity for the Church&rsquo;s
      combating modern pessimism; (18) the Church&rsquo;s position as a purveyor of
      healthy literature for the young; (19) his reluctance to take up any more
      of their valuable time, and (20) his assurance that the remarks of their
      spokesman would have his earnest and prayerful attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deputation then thanked his lordship and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still the bishop made no move in the matter, and the friends of the
      Rev. George Holland felt grievously disappointed. They had counted on the
      bishop&rsquo;s at least writing a letter of remonstrance to the rector of St.
      Chad&rsquo;s, and upon the publication of the letter, with the rector&rsquo;s reply in
      the newspapers; but now quite two months had passed since the appearance
      of &ldquo;Revised Versions,&rdquo; the bishop had returned from the Engadine, and
      still there were no indications of his intention to make the Rev. George
      Holland responsible to the right tribunal&mdash;whatever that was&mdash;for
      his doctrines. They counted on his martyrdom within six months; and,
      consequently, upon his election to a position of distinction in the eyes
      of his fellow-country-men&mdash;or, at least, of his country-women. But
      the bishop they found to be a poor thing after all. They felt sure that
      what the people said about his being quite humble in the presence of his
      wife was not without some foundation; and they thought that, after all,
      there was a great deal to be said in favor of the celibacy of priests
      compulsory in the Church of Rome. If the bishops of the Church of England
      were not very careful, they might be the means of such a going over to
      Rome as had never previously been witnessed in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Holland may have been disappointed, or he may have been pleased at
      the inactivity of the bishop. He made no sign one way or the other. Of
      course he was no more than human: he would have regarded a letter of
      remonstrance from the bishop as a personal compliment; he had certainly
      expected such a letter, for he had already put together the heads of the
      reply he would make&mdash;and publish&mdash;to any official remonstrance
      that might be offered to him. Still he made no sign. He preached at least
      one sermon every Sunday morning, and whenever it was known that he would
      preach, St. Chad&rsquo;s was crowded and the offertory was all that could be
      desired. The bishop&rsquo;s chaplain no longer held a watching brief in regard
      in regard to those sermons. He did not think it worth while to do so much,
      George Holland&rsquo;s friends said, shaking their heads and pursing out their
      lips. Oh, yes! there could be no doubt that the bishop was a very weak
      sort of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then suddenly there appeared in the new number of the <i>Zeit Geist
      Review</i> an article above the signature of George Holland, entitled &ldquo;The
      Enemy to Christianity,&rdquo; and in a moment it became pretty plain that George
      Holland had not in his &ldquo;Revised Versions,&rdquo; said the last word that he had
      to say regarding the attitude of the Church of England in respect of the
      non-church-goers of the day. When people read the article they asked &ldquo;Who
      is the Enemy to Christianity referred to by the writer?&rdquo; and they were
      forced to conclude that the answer which was made to such an inquiry by
      the article itself was, &ldquo;The Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He pointed out the infatuation which possessed the heads of the Church of
      England in expecting to appeal with success to the educated people of the
      present day, while still declining to move with the course of thought of
      the people. Already the braying of a trombone out of tune, and the
      barbarous jingle of a tambourine, had absorbed some hundred thousand of
      possible church-goers; and though, of course, it was impossible for
      sensible men and women&mdash;the people whom the Church should endeavor to
      grapple to its soul with hooks of steel&mdash;to look, except with amused
      sadness, at the ludicrous methods and vulgar ineptitude of the Salvation
      Army, still the Church was making no effort to provide the sensible,
      thinking, educated people of England with an equivalent as suitable to
      their requirements as the Salvation Army was to the requirements of the
      foolish, the hysterical, the unthinking people who played the tambourines
      and brayed on the tuneless trombones. Thus it is that one man says to
      another nowadays, when he has got nothing better to talk about, &ldquo;Are you a
      man of intelligence, or do you go to church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Men of intelligence do not go to church nowadays, Mr. Holland announced in
      that article of his in the <i>Zeit Geist</i>; many women of intelligence
      refrain from going, he added, though many beautifully dressed women were
      still frequent attenders. There was no blinking the fact that the crass
      stupidity of the Church had made church-going unpopular&mdash;almost
      impossible&mdash;with intelligent men and women. The Church insulted the
      intelligence by trying to reconcile the teachings of Judaism with the
      teachings of Christianity, when the two were absolutely irreconcilable. It
      was the crass stupidity of the Church that had caused it&mdash;for its
      self-protection, it fancied&mdash;to bitterly oppose every truth that was
      revealed to man. The Church had tortured and burned at the stake the great
      men to whom God had revealed the great facts of nature&rsquo;s workings&mdash;the
      motion of the earth and the other planets. But these facts, being Divine
      Truth, became accepted by the world in spite of the thumb-screws and the
      fagots&mdash;the arguments of the Church against Divine Truth. The list of
      the Divine Truths which the Church had bitterly opposed was a sickening
      document. Geography, Geology, Biology&mdash;the progress of all had, even
      within recent years, been bitterly opposed by the Church, and yet the
      self-constituted arbiters between Truth and falsehood had been compelled
      to eat their own words&mdash;to devour their own denunciations when they
      found that the Truth was accepted by the intelligence of the people in
      spite of the anathemas of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligence of the Church was equal only to the duty of burning
      witches. It burned them by the thousand, simply because ancient Judaism
      had a profound belief in the witch and because a blood-thirsty Jewish
      murderer-monarch had organized a witch hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet with such a record against it&mdash;a record of the murder of
      innocent men and women who endeavored to promulgate the Divine Truths of
      nature&mdash;the Church still arrogated to itself the right to lay down a
      rule of life for intelligent people&mdash;a rule of life founded upon that
      impossible amalgamation of Judaism and Christianity. The science of the
      Church was not equal to the task of amalgamating two such deadly
      opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it any wonder, then, that church-going had become practically obsolete
      among intelligent men and women? the writer asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then went on to refer to the nature of the existing services of the
      Church of England. He dealt only casually with the mockery of the response
      of the congregation to the reading out of the Fourth Commandment by the
      priest, when no one in the Church paid the least respect to the Seventh
      Day. This was additional proof of the absurdity of the attempted
      amalgamation of Judaism and Christianity. But what he dealt most fully
      with was the indiscriminate selection of what were very properly termed
      the &ldquo;Lessons&rdquo; from the Hebrew Bible. It was, he said, far from edifying to
      hear some chapters read out from the lectern without comment; though
      fortunately the readers were as a rule so imperfectly trained that the
      most objectionable passages had their potentiality of mischief minimized.
      He concluded his indictment by a reference to a sermon preached by the
      average clergyman of the Church of England. This was, usually, he said,
      either a theological essay founded upon an obsolete system of theology, or
      a series of platitudes of morality delivered by an unpractical man. The
      first was an insult to the intelligence of an average man; the second was
      an insult to the intelligence of an average schoolgirl.
    </p>
    <p>
      His summing up of the whole case against the Church was as logical as it
      was trenchant. The Church had surely become, he said, like unto the Giant
      Pagan in &ldquo;The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,&rdquo; who, when incapable of doing mischief,
      sat mumbling at the mouth of his cave on the roadside. The Church had
      become toothless, decrepit either for evil or for good. Its mouthings of
      the past had become its mumblings of the present. The cave at the mouth of
      which this toothless giant sat was very dark; and intelligent people went
      by with a good-natured and tolerant laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      This article was published in the <i>Review</i> on Tuesday. Phyllis read
      it on the evening of that day. On Wednesday the newspapers were full of
      this further development of the theories of the writer, and on Thursday
      afternoon the writer paid a visit to Phyllis.

    <p>
      The prayer of Ella Linton had not been answered. She had prayed, not that
      her heart wherewith she loved Herbert Courtland might be changed&mdash;that
      she knew would be difficult; not that her love for Herbert Courtland might
      cease&mdash;that she believed to be impossible; but simply that Herbert
      Courtland might be kept away from her&mdash;that she knew to be the most
      sensible course her scheme of imploration could take.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was well aware of the fact that God had given her strength to run away
      from Herbert Courtland, and for that she was sincerely thankful; she did
      not pause to analyze her feelings, to ask herself if her thanks were due
      to her reflection upon the circumstance of her husband&rsquo;s return, at the
      very hour when she had appointed to meet Herbert Courtland; she only felt
      that God had been good to her in giving her sufficient strength to run
      away from that appointment. Then it was that she had prayed that he might
      be kept away from her. Surely God would find it easy to do that, she
      thought. Surely she might assume that God was on her side, and that he
      would not leave his work half done.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she began to think of the thorough manner in which God does his
      work she began to wish that she had not prayed quite so earnestly.
      Supposing that God should think it fit to keep him away from her by
      sending a blast from heaven to capsize that yacht in the deep sea, what
      would she think of the fervency of her prayer then?
    </p>
    <p>
      The terror of her reflection upon the possibility of this occurrence flung
      her from her bed and sent her pacing, with bare feet and flying lace, the
      floor of her bedroom in the first pearly light of dawn, just as she had
      paced the floor of Phyllis&rsquo; drawing room beneath the glow of the electric
      lights.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wished that she had not prayed quite so earnestly that he might be
      kept apart from her. But one cannot pray hot and cold; she felt that she
      had no right now to lay down any conditions to Heaven in the matter of
      keeping Herbert Courtland away from her. She had prayed her prayer; only,
      if he were drowned before she saw him again, she would never say another
      prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This feeling that she would be even with Heaven, so to speak, had the
      effect of soothing her. She threw herself upon her bed once more and was
      able to fall asleep; she had a considerable amount of confidence in the
      discrimination of Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before she had come down to the breakfast room where her husband was
      reading a newspaper in the morning, she had thought a good deal upon
      another matter that disquieted her in some degree. She had been exuberant
      (she thought) at having had sufficient strength given to her to run away
      from her lover; but then she had not dwelt upon the rather important
      circumstance that all the running away had not been on her side. What were
      the facts as revealed by the narrative of Mr. Ayrton? Why, simply, that
      while she was putting on that supreme toilet which she had prepared for
      the delight of the eyes of her lover (feeling herself to be a modern
      Cleopatra), that lover of hers was sitting on the cushions of a
      first-class carriage, flying along to Southampton; and while she had been
      lying among the cushions of her drawing room, waiting tremulously,
      nervously, ecstatically, for the dreary minutes to crawl on until the
      clock should chime the hour of nine, he was probably lighting his first
      pipe aboard the yacht <i>Water Nymph</i>. What did it matter that she had
      lifted her hot face from her cushions and had fled in wild haste to the
      arms of Phyllis Ayrton? The fact remained the same; it was he who had run
      away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a terrible reflection. Hitherto she had never felt humiliated.
      She had not felt that he had insulted her by his kisses; she had given him
      kiss for kiss. She had but to hold up her finger and he was ready to obey
      her. But now&mdash;what was she to think of him? Had ever man so
      humiliated woman? She had offered him, not her heart but her soul&mdash;had
      he not told her a few days before that he meant her to give him her soul?
      and when she had laid heart and soul at his feet&mdash;that was how she
      put it to herself&mdash;he had not considered it worth his while to take
      the priceless gift that she offered to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will answer to me for that,&rdquo; she said, as she thought over her
      humiliation, in front of her dressing-glass that morning, while her maid
      was absent from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her wish was now not that her prayer had been less earnest, but that it
      had not been uttered at all. It was necessary for her to meet him again in
      order that he might explain to her how it came that he had preferred the
      attractions incidental to a cruise with Lord Earlscourt and his friends to
      all that she had written to offer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet when her husband, after having quite finished with his paper,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very awkward that Herbert Courtland is not in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She merely raised her shoulders an inch, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose that he has a right to take a holiday now and then. If you
      didn&rsquo;t telegraph to him from Paris, you cannot complain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt certain that I should find him here,&rdquo; said the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here?&rdquo; said the wife, raising her eyebrows and casting an offended glance
      at her husband. &ldquo;Here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled in the face of her offended glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;in London, I mean, of course. Heavens, Ella! did you fancy for
      a moment that I meant&mdash;&mdash;Ah, by the way, you have seen him
      recently?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; quite recently&mdash;on Tuesday, I think it was, we met at the
      Ayrton&rsquo;s dinner party&mdash;yes, it was Tuesday. There was some fuss, or
      attempted fuss, about his adventures in New Guinea, and a question was
      being asked about the matter in the House of Commons. Mr. Ayrton got rid
      of some of his superfluous cleverness in putting a counter question&mdash;you
      know the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, perfectly well! And that is how you met on Tuesday&mdash;if it was
      Tuesday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he went to thank Mr. Ayrton, and Mr. Ayrton asked him to dinner. It
      was a small party, and not very brilliant. Herbert came here with me
      afterward&mdash;for five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! To get the taste of the party off his mouth, I suppose? He didn&rsquo;t say
      anything to you then about being tired of his London season?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a word. He seemed tired of the dinner party. He yawned.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure that you yawned in sympathy. When a man so far forgets
      himself as to yawn in the presence of a woman, she never fails to respond
      with one of more ample circumference. When a woman so far remembers
      herself as to yawn in the presence of a man, he tries to say something
      witty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when the woman is not his wife. If she is his wife, he asks her if
      she doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s about time she was in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say you&rsquo;re right; you have observed men&mdash;and women, for that
      matter&mdash;much more closely than I have had time to do. It&rsquo;s very
      awkward that he isn&rsquo;t here. I must bring him back at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She felt a little movement at her heart; but she only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that, if I were you. Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be allowed to enjoy
      his holiday in peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of business; the mine, I told you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with the mine that could be set right by his coming back at
      once? Are you not making enough out of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re making quite as much as is good for us out of it. But if we can get
      a hundred and fifty thousand pounds for a few yards of our claim further
      east, without damaging the prospects of the mine itself, I don&rsquo;t think we
      should refuse it&mdash;at any rate, I don&rsquo;t think that we should refuse to
      consider the offer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is a hundred and fifty thousand pounds?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder why you dressed yourself as you did last night?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suddenness of the words did not cause her to quail as the guilty wife
      quails&mdash;yes, under a properly managed lime-light. She did not even
      color. But then, of course, she was not a guilty wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay back on her chair and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her&mdash;not eagerly, but pleasantly, admiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Stephen, if you could understand why I dressed myself that way
      you would be able to give me a valuable hint as to where the connection
      lies between your mine and my toilet&mdash;I need such a hint, now, I can
      assure you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting up now looking at him with lovely laughing eyes. (After
      all, she was no guilty wife.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, you can&rsquo;t see the connection?&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;You can sew over
      your dress about fifty thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of diamonds, and yet you
      don&rsquo;t see the connection between the wearing of that dress and the
      development of a gold mine by your husband?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I see it now&mdash;something of a connection. But I don&rsquo;t want
      any more diamonds; I don&rsquo;t care if you take all that are sewed about the
      dress and throw them into the river. That&rsquo;s how I feel this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard some time ago of a woman who had something of your mood upon her
      one day. She had some excellent diamonds, and in one of her moods, she
      flung them into the river. She was a wife and she had a lover who
      disappointed her. The story reads very smoothly in verse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no lover,&rdquo; she said&mdash;was it mournfully? &ldquo;I have a husband, it
      is true; but he is not exactly of the type of King Arthur&mdash;nor Sir
      Galahad, for that matter. I hope you found Paris as enjoyable as ever?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite. I never saw at Paris a more enrapturing toilet than yours of last
      night. You are, I know, the handsomest woman of my acquaintance, and you
      looked handsomer than I had ever before seen you in that costume. I wonder
      why you put it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t someone&mdash;was it Phyllis?&mdash;suggest that it was an act of
      inspiration; that I had a secret, mysterious prompting to put it on to
      achieve the object which&mdash;well, which I did achieve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Object? What object?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To make my husband fall in love with me again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! In love there is no again. I wonder where a telegram would find
      Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself about him. Let him enjoy his holiday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you fancy he is enjoying himself with Earlscourt and his boon
      companions? They&rsquo;ll be playing poker from morning till night&mdash;certainly
      from night till morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he go on the cruise if he was not certain to enjoy himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that question is too much for me. Think over it yourself and let me
      know if you come to a solution, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and left the room before she could make any answer&mdash;before
      she could make an attempt to find out in what direction his thoughts
      regarding the departure of Herbert Courtland were moving.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wondered if he had any suspicion in regard to Herbert and herself. He
      was not a man given to suspicion, or at any rate, given to allowing
      whatever suspicion he may have felt, to be apparent. He had allowed her to
      drive and to ride with Herbert Courtland during the four months they had
      been together, first at Egypt, then at Florence, Vienna, Munich, and
      Paris, and he could not have but seen that Herbert and she had a good many
      sympathies in common. Not a word had been breathed, however, of a
      suspicion that they were more than good friends to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      (As a matter of fact, they had not been more than good friends to each
      other; but then some husbands are given to unworthy suspicions.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be possible, she asked herself, that some people with nasty minds
      had suggested to him in Paris that she and Herbert were together a great
      deal in London, and that he had been led to make this sudden visit, this
      surprise visit to London, with a view of satisfying himself as to the
      truth of the nasty reports&mdash;the disgraceful calumnies which had
      reached his ears?
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had done so, all that could be said was that he had been singularly
      unfortunate in regard to his visit. &ldquo;Unfortunate&rdquo; was the word which was
      in her mind, though, of course <i>&ldquo;fortunate&rdquo;</i> was the word which
      should have occurred to her. It was certainly a fortunate result of his
      visit&mdash;that tableau in the drawing room of Mr. Ayrton: Ella and her
      dearest friend standing side by side, hand in hand, as he entered. A
      surprise visit, it may have been, but assuredly the surprise was a
      pleasant one for the husband, if he had listened to the voice of calumny.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, after pondering upon this with a smiling face, her smile
      suddenly vanished. She was overwhelmed with the thought of what might have
      been the result of that surprise visit&mdash;yes, if she had not had the
      strength to run away to the side of Phyllis; yes, if Herbert had not had
      the weakness to join that party of poker-players aboard the yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to wonder what her husband would have done if he had entered the
      house by the aid of his latch-key, and had found her sitting in that
      lovely costume by the side of Herbert Courtland? Would he have thought her
      a guilty woman? Would he have thought Herbert a false friend? Would he
      have killed her, or would he have killed Herbert? Herbert would, she
      thought, take a good deal of killing from a man of the caliber of her
      husband; but what could she have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, what she did, as the force of that thought crushed her back upon her
      chair, was to bring her hands together in a passionate clasp, and to cry
      in a passionate gasp:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God&mdash;thank God&mdash;thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She dined alone with her husband that night, and thought it well to appear
      in another evening toilet&mdash;one that was quite as lovely, though
      scarcely so striking, as that which her husband had so admired the
      previous night. He clearly appreciated her efforts to maintain her
      loveliness in his eyes, and their little dinner was a very pleasant one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told her that he had learned that the yacht <i>Water Nymph</i> would
      put in to Leith before crossing the North Sea, and that he had written to
      Herbert Courtland at that port to return without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did wrong,&rdquo; said she; and she felt that she was speaking the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;At any rate, you may rest perfectly
      certain that Herbert will receive my letter with gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Linton&rsquo;s judgment on this point was not in error. Herbert
      Courtland received, on the evening of the third day after leaving
      Southampton, the letter which called him back to London, and he contrived
      to conceal whatever emotion he may have felt at the prospect of parting
      from his shipmates. They accompanied him ashore, however&mdash;they had
      worn out six packs of cards already, and were about to buy another dozen
      or two, to see them safely through the imposing scenery of the Hardanger
      Fjord.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day he was in London, and it was on the evening of that same day
      that he came face to face with the Rev. George Holland outside Miss
      Ayrton&rsquo;s drawing room.

    <h3>
      LIES! LIES! LIES!
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have come a little sooner,&rdquo; said Phyllis quite pleasantly.
      &ldquo;Mr. Courtland was giving me such an amusing account of his latest voyage.
      Will you have tea or iced coffee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tea, if you please,&rdquo; said George Holland, also quite pleasantly. &ldquo;Has Mr.
      Courtland been on another voyage of discovery? What has he left himself to
      discover in the world of waters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that what he discovered on his latest voyage was the effect of a
      banjo on the human mind,&rdquo; laughed Phyllis. &ldquo;He was aboard Lord
      Earlscourt&rsquo;s yacht, the <i>Water Nymph</i>. Some other men were there
      also. One of them had an idea that he could play upon the banjo. He was
      wrong, Mr. Courtland thinks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good many people are subject to curious notions of the same type. They
      usually take an optimistic view of the susceptibilities of enjoyment of
      their neighbors&mdash;not that there is any connection between enjoyment
      and a banjo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Courtland said just now that when Dr. Johnson gave it as his opinion
      that music was, of all noises, the least disagreeable, the banjo had not
      been invented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That assumes that there is some connection between music and the banjo,
      and that&rsquo;s going just a little too far, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to hear Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s criticism of Paderewski.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His criticism of Signor Piozzi is extant: a fine piece of eighteenth
      century directness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes long for an hour or two of the eighteenth century. You
      remember Fanny Burney&rsquo;s reference to the gentleman who thought it
      preposterous that Reynolds should have increased his price for a portrait
      to thirty guineas, though he admitted that Reynolds was a good enough sort
      of man for a painter. I think I should like to have an hour with that
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I long for more than that. I should like to have seen David Garrick&rsquo;s
      reproduction, for the benefit of his schoolfellows, of Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s love
      passages with his very mature wife. I should also like to have heard the
      complete story of old Grouse in the gun room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told by Squire Hardcastle, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. I question if there was anything very much better aboard the
      <i>Water Nymph</i>. By the way, Lady Earlscourt invited me to join the
      yachting party. She did not mention it to her husband, however. She
      thought that there should be a chaplain aboard. Now, considering that Lord
      Earlscourt had told me the previous day that he was compelled to take to
      the sea solely on account of the way people were worrying him about me, I
      think that I did the right thing when I told her that I should be
      compelled to stay at home until the appearance of a certain paper of mine
      in the <i>Zeit Geist Review</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that you did the right thing when you stayed at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in writing the paper in the <i>Zeit Geist</i>? You have read it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! I have read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could I like it? You have known me now for sometime. How could you
      fancy that I should like it&mdash;that is, if you thought of me at all in
      connection with it? I don&rsquo;t myself see why you should think of me at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and stood before her. She had risen to take his empty cup from
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that I think of you always, Phyllis?&rdquo; he said, in that low
      tone of his which flowed around the hearts of his hearers, and made their
      hearts as one with his heart. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that I think of you always&mdash;that
      all my hopes are centered in you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry if that is the case, Mr. Holland,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want
      to give you pain, but I must tell you again what I told you long ago: you
      have passed completely out of my life. If you had not done so before, the
      publication of that article in the <i>Zeit Geist</i> would force me to
      tell you that you had done so now. To me my religion has always been a
      living thing; my Bible has been my guide. You trampled upon the one some
      months ago, you have trampled on the other now. You shocked me, Mr.
      Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have always loved you, Phyllis. I think I love you better than I ever
      did, if that were possible,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I am overwhelmed with grief at the
      thought of the barrier which your fancy has built up between us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your fancy, dear child. I feel that the barrier which you fancy is now
      between us is unworthy of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Do you mean to say that you think that my detestation&mdash;my&mdash;my
      horror of your sneers at the Bible, which I believe to be the Word of God&mdash;of
      the contempt you have heaped upon the Church which I believe to be God&rsquo;s
      agent on earth for the salvation of men&rsquo;s souls&mdash;do you think that my
      detestation of these is a mere girlish fancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that, Phyllis. What I think is, that if you had ever loved
      me you would be ready to stand by my side now&mdash;to be guided by me in
      a matter which I have made the study of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such matters as these&mdash;the value or the worthlessness of the
      Bible; the value or the worthlessness of the Church&mdash;I require no
      guide, Mr. Holland. I do not need to go to a priest to ask if it is wrong
      to steal, to covet another&rsquo;s goods, to honor my father&mdash;&mdash;Oh, I
      cannot discuss what is so very obvious. The Bible I regard as precious;
      you think that you are in a position to edit it as if it were an ordinary
      book. The Church I regard as the Temple of God upon the earth; you think
      that it exists only to be sneered at? and yet you talk of fanciful
      barriers between us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider it the greatest privilege of a man on earth to be a minister
      of the Church of Christ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, do you take every opportunity of pointing to it as the
      greatest enemy to Christianity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Church of to-day represents some results of the great Reformation.
      That Reformation was due to the intelligence of those men who perceived
      that it had become the enemy to freedom; the enemy to the development of
      thought; the enemy to the aspirations of a great nation. The nation
      rejoiced in the freedom of thought of which the great charter was the
      Reformation. But during the hundreds of years that have elapsed since that
      Reformation, some enormous changes have been brought about in the daily
      life of the people of this great nation. The people are being educated,
      and the Church must sooner or later face the fact that as education
      spreads church-going decreases. Why is that, I ask you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because men are growing more wicked every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are not. Crime is steadily decreasing as education is spreading,
      and yet people will not go to church. They will go to lectures, to bands
      of music, to political demonstrations, but they will not go to church. The
      reason they will not go is because they know that they will hear within
      the church the arguments of men whose minds are stunted by a narrow
      theological course against every discovery of science or result of
      investigation. You know how the best minds in the Church ridiculed the
      discoveries of geology, of biology, ending, of course, by reluctantly
      accepting the teachings of the men whom they reviled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said all that in your paper, Mr. Holland, and yet I tell you that I
      abhor your paper&mdash;that I shuddered when I read what you wrote about
      the Bible. The words that are in the Bible have given to millions of poor
      souls a consolation that science could never bring to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And those consoling words are what I would read to the people every day
      of the week, not the words which may have a certain historical
      signification, but which breathe a very different spirit from the spirit
      of Christianity. Phyllis, it is to be the aim of my life to help on the
      great work of making the Church once more the Church of the people&mdash;of
      making it in reality the exponent of Christianity and Judaism. That is my
      aim, and I want you to be my helper in this work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I tell you that I shall oppose you by all the means in my power,
      paltry though my power may be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were flashing and she made a little automatic motion with her
      hands, as if sweeping something away from before her. He had become pale
      and there was a light in his eyes. He felt angry at this girl who had
      shown herself ready to argue with him,&mdash;in her girlish fashion, of
      course,&mdash;and who, after listening to his incontrovertible arguments,
      fell back resolutely upon a platitude, and considered that she had got the
      better of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had got the better of him, too; that was the worst of it; his object
      in going to her, in arguing with her, was to induce her to promise to
      marry him, and he had failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this account he was angry. He might have had a certain
      consciousness of succeeding as a theologian, but he had undoubtedly failed
      as a lover. He was angry. He was as little accustomed as other clergymen
      to be withstood by a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am disappointed in you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I fancied that when I&mdash;when I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       It was in his mind to say that he had selected her out of a large number
      of candidates to be his helpmeet, but he pulled himself up in time, and
      the pause that he made seemed purely emotional. &ldquo;When I loved you and got
      your promise to love me in return, you would share with me all the glory,
      the persecution, the work incidental to this crusade on behalf of the
      truth, but now&mdash;&mdash;Ah! you can never have loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right, indeed,&rdquo; said she meekly. She was ready to cede
      him this point if he set any store by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said he, with some measure of sternness. &ldquo;Take care, if you
      fancy you love another man, that he may be worthy of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not love another man, Mr. Holland,&rdquo; said she gently; scarcely
      regretfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not?&rdquo; said he, with equal gentleness. &ldquo;Then I will hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do very wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot say that without loving someone else. I would not like to hear
      of your loving such a man as Herbert Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started at that piece of impertinence, and then, without the slightest
      further warning, she felt her body blaze from head to foot. She was
      speechless with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I should have said a word of warning to you before.&rdquo; He had now
      assumed the calm dignity of a clergyman who knows what is due to himself.
      &ldquo;I am not one to place credence in vulgar gossip; I thought that your
      father, perhaps, might have given you a hint. Mrs. Linton is undoubtedly a
      very silly woman. God forbid that I should ever hear rumor play with your
      name as I have heard it deal with hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His assumption of the clergyman&rsquo;s solemn dignity did not make his remark
      less impertinent, considering that Ella Linton was her dearest friend. And
      yet people were in the habit of giving George Holland praise for his tact.
      Such persons had never seen him angry, wounded, and anxious to wound.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause after he had spoken his tactless words. It was broken by
      a thrice-repeated cry from Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lies! Lies! Lies!&rdquo; she cried, facing him, the light of scorn in her eyes.
      &ldquo;I tell you that you have listened to lies; you, a clergyman, have
      listened to lying gossip, and have repeated that lying gossip to me. You
      have listened like a wicked man, and you should be ashamed of your
      behavior, of your words, your wicked words. If Ella Linton were wicked,
      you would be responsible for it in the sight of God. You, a clergyman,
      whose duty it is to help the weak ones, to give counsel to those who stand
      on the brink of danger; you speak your own condemnation if you speak Ella
      Linton&rsquo;s. You have spent your time not in that practical work of the
      Church&mdash;that work which is done silently by those of her priests who
      are desirous of doing their duty; you have spent your time, not in this
      work, but in theorizing, in inventing vain sophistries to put in a book,
      and so cause people to talk about you; whether they talk well or ill of
      you, you care not so long as they talk; you have been doing this to
      gratify your own vanity, instead of doing your duty as a clergyman on
      behalf of the souls which have been intrusted to your keeping. Go away&mdash;go
      away! I am ashamed of you; I am ashamed of myself that I was ever foolish
      enough to allow my name to be associated with yours even for a single day.
      I shall never, never again enter the church where you preach. Go away! Go
      away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood before her with his hands by his sides as a man suddenly
      paralyzed might stand. He had never recovered from the shock produced by
      her crying of the word &ldquo;lies! lies! lies!&rdquo; He was dazed. He was barely
      conscious of the injustice which she was doing him, for he felt that he
      was not actuated by vanity, but sincerity in all that he had hitherto
      preached and written regarding the Church. Still he had not the power to
      interrupt her in her accusation; he had not the power to tell her that she
      was falsely accusing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her impassioned denunciation of him had come to an end, and she stood
      with flaming face, one outstretched hand pointing to the door, he
      recovered himself&mdash;partially; and curiously enough, his first thought
      was that he had never seen a more beautiful girl in a more graceful
      attitude. She had insulted him grossly; she had behaved as none of the
      daughters of Philistia would behave in regard to him&mdash;him, a
      clergyman of the Church of England; but he forgot her insults, her
      injustice, and his only thought was that she was surely the most beautiful
      woman in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am amazed!&rdquo; he found words to say at last. &ldquo;I am amazed! I felt certain
      that you at least would do me justice. I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not listen to you,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Every word you utter increases my
      self-contempt at having heard you say so much as you have said. Go away,
      please. No, I will go&mdash;I will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she did go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself standing in the middle of an empty room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had he been so treated by man or woman; and the worst of the
      matter was that he had an uneasy feeling that he had deserved the scorn
      which she had heaped upon him. He knew perfectly well that he had no right
      to speak to her as he had spoken regarding her friend, Ella Linton. Rumor&mdash;what
      right had he to suggest to her, as he had certainly done, that the evil
      rumors regarding her friend were believed by him at least?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he felt that she had treated him as he deserved; and when he tried to
      get up a case for himself, so to speak, by dwelling upon the injustice
      which she had done him in saying that he had been actuated by vanity,
      whereas he knew that he had been sincere, he completely failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his greatest humiliation was due to a consciousness of his own want of
      tact. Any man may forget himself so far as to lose his temper upon
      occasions; but no man need hope to get on in the world who so far forgets
      himself as to allow other people to perceive that he has lost his temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      What was left for him to do but to leave the house with as little delay as
      possible?
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down the stairs, and a footman opened the hall door for him. He
      felt a good deal better in the open air. Even the large drawing room which
      he had left was beginning to feel stuffy. (He was a singularly sensitive
      man.)
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the rectory he found two letters waiting for him. One from the
      bishop requesting an early interview with him. The other was almost
      identical but it was signed &ldquo;Stephen Linton.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DID HE SAY SOMETHING MORE ABOUT RUTH?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Herbert Courtland had found his way to her drawing room on the afternoon
      of his return to London; and it was upon this circumstance rather than
      upon her own unusual behavior in the presence of George Holland that
      Phyllis was dwelling so soon as she had recovered from her tearful
      outburst on her bed. (She had, of course, run into her bedroom and thrown
      herself upon the bed the moment that she had left the presence of the man
      whom she had once promised to marry.) She had wept in the sheer excitement
      of the scene in which she had played the part of leading lady; it had been
      a very exciting scene, and it had overwhelmed her; she had not accustomed
      herself to the use of such vehement language as she had found necessary to
      employ in order to adequately deal with Mr. Holland and that was how it
      came about that she was overwhelmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But so soon as she had partially recovered from her excitement, and had
      dried her eyes, she began to think of the visit which had been paid to
      her, not by George Holland, but by Herbert Courtland. She dwelt, moreover,
      less upon his amusing account of the cruise of the <i>Water Nymph</i> than
      upon the words which he had said to her in regard to his last visit. She
      had expressed her surprise at seeing him. Had he not gone on a yachting
      cruise to Norway? Surely five days was under rather than over the space of
      time necessary to thoroughly enjoy the fine scenery of the fjords.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had then laughed and said that he had received a letter at Leith making
      his immediate return absolutely necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How disappointed you must have felt!&rdquo; she suggested, with something like
      a smile upon her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His smile was broader as he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not so sure that my disappointment was such as would tend to
      make me take a gloomy view of life for an indefinite time. Lord Earlscourt
      is a very good sort of fellow; but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I quite agree with you,&rdquo; said she, still smiling. &ldquo;Knowing what
      follows that &lsquo;but&rsquo; in everyone&rsquo;s mind, we all thought it rather strange on
      your part to start on that cruise. And so suddenly you seemed to make up
      your mind, too. You never hinted to me that afternoon that you were
      anxious to see Norway under the personal conductorship of Lord
      Earlscourt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would have been impossible for me to give you such a hint,&rdquo; said he.
      &ldquo;I had no idea myself that I wanted greatly to go to Norway, until I met
      Earlscourt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we gathered from what papa told us when he came in about midnight,
      bringing Mr. Linton with him,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;Ella had come across to me
      before nine, to ask me to go with her to &lsquo;Romeo and Juliet&rsquo; at Covent
      Garden, forgetting that I was dining with Lady Earlscourt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you had not returned from the dinner party at nine,&rdquo; he suggested.
      She had certainly succeeded in arousing his interest, even in such
      ordinary details as those she was describing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not; but Ella waited for me; I suppose she did not want to
      return to her lonely house. She seemed so glad when I came in that she
      made up her mind to stay with me all night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! But she didn&rsquo;t stay with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, when her husband appeared. It was so funny&mdash;so
      startling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So funny&mdash;so startling! Yes, it must have been&mdash;funny.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella was wearing such a lovely frock&mdash;covered with diamonds. I wish
      that you had seen her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw anything so lovely. I told her that it was a bridal toilet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A bridal toilet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We thought it such a pity that it should be wasted. She didn&rsquo;t go to the
      opera, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it was wasted&mdash;wasted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! When her husband came in with papa, about midnight, we laughed
      and said that her dressing herself in that way was an inspiration; that
      something told her that he was returning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably a telegram from Paris had told her; that was the source of her
      inspiration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! what was so funny about the matter was that Mr. Linton&rsquo;s servant
      bungled sending the telegram, so that Ella knew nothing of his coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not seen Ella since your return?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have been with her husband on business all day, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of course he would not have occasion to refer to so casual an
      incident as his wife&rsquo;s wearing a new toilet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. The word inspiration has no place in a commercial
      vocabulary, Miss Ayrton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is a good word elsewhere, Mr. Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it has its meaning. You think that it may be safely applied to the
      wearing of an effective toilet. I wonder if you would think of applying it
      to the words you said to me on the last evening I was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was in a very low tone, and after a long pause, that she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope if what I told you Mrs. Haddon said was an inspiration, it was a
      good one. I felt that I must tell you, Mr. Courtland, though I fear that I
      gave you some pain&mdash;great pain. I know what it is to be reminded of
      an irreparable loss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pain&mdash;pain?&rdquo; said he. Then he raised his eyes to hers. &ldquo;I wonder if
      you will ever know what effect your words had upon me, Miss Ayrton?&rdquo; he
      added. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose that you will ever know; but I tell you that it
      would be impossible for me ever to cease to think of you as my good
      angel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flushed slightly, very slightly, before saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How odd that Ella should call me her good angel, too, on that same
      night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she spoke the truth, if ever truth was spoken,&rdquo; he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face was very serious as she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I don&rsquo;t understand anything of this, Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it would be impossible for you to understand anything of
      it. It would be impossible for you to understand how I feel toward you&mdash;how
      I have felt toward you since you spoke those words in this room; those
      words that came to me as the light from heaven came to Saul of Tarsus;
      words of salvation. Believe me, I shall never forget them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I am glad, though, as I say, I understand
      nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then there had been a long interval of silence before she had asked him
      something further regarding the yachting party.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she was lying on her bed trying to recall every word that he had
      spoken, and with a dread over her that what he had said would bear out
      that terrible suspicion which she had prayed to God to forgive her for
      entertaining on that night when Ella had gone home with her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      No rumor had reached her ears regarding the closeness of the intimacy
      existing between Mr. Courtland and Mrs. Linton; and thus it was that when
      that suspicion had come upon her, after Ella had left her, she felt that
      she was guilty of something akin to a crime&mdash;a horrible breach of
      friendship, only to be expiated by tears and prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      That terrible thought had been borne upon her as a suggestion to account
      for much that she could not understand in the words and the behavior of
      Ella during that remarkable evening; and, in spite of her remorse and her
      prayers, she could not rid herself of it. It left its impression upon her
      mind, upon her heart. Hitherto she had only heard about the way an
      unlawful passion sweeps over two people, causing them to fling to the
      winds all considerations of home, of husband, of religion, of honor; and
      she felt it to be very terrible to be brought face to face with such a
      power; it seemed to her as terrible as to be brought face to face with
      that personal Satan in whom she believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It only required such a hint as that which had come from George Holland to
      set her smoldering suspicion&mdash;suspicion of a suspicion&mdash;in a
      flame. It had flamed up before him in those words which she had spoken to
      him. If Ella were guilty, he, George Holland, was to be held responsible
      for her guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Ella was not guilty; Herbert Courtland was not guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; she cried, in the solitude of her chamber. &ldquo;She did not talk
      as a guilty woman would talk; and he&mdash;he went straight out of the
      room where I had told him what Mrs. Haddon said about his mother, his
      sister&mdash;straight aboard the yacht; and she&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once the truth flashed upon her; the truth&mdash;she felt that it
      was the truth; and both of them were guiltless. It was for Herbert
      Courtland that Ella had put on that lovely dress; but she was guiltless,
      he was guiltless. (Curiously enough, she felt quite as happy in the
      thought that he was guiltless.) Yes, Ella had come to her wearing that
      dress instead of waiting for him, and he&mdash;&mdash;Ah, she now knew
      what he had meant when he had called her his good angel. She had saved
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself on her knees in a passion of thanksgiving to God for
      having made her the means of saving a soul from hell&mdash;yes, for the
      time being.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she began to think what she should do in order that that soul
      should be saved forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was time for her to dress for dinner before she had finished working
      out that great question, possibly the greatest question that ever
      engrossed the attention of a young woman: how to save the soul of a man,
      not temporarily, but eternally.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the time that she was in her room alone she had not a single
      thought regarding the scene through which she had passed with the Rev.
      George Holland. She had utterly forgotten him and his wickedness&mdash;his
      vain sophistries. She had forgotten all that he had said to her&mdash;his
      monstrous calumny leveled against her dearest friend; she even forgot her
      unjust treatment of George Holland and her rudeness&mdash;her unparalleled
      rudeness toward him. She was thinking over something very much more
      important. What was a question of mere etiquette compared to the question
      of saving a man&rsquo;s soul alive?
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she dined opposite to her father it was to the visit of George
      Holland she referred rather than to the visit of Herbert Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What had George Holland got to say that was calculated to interest you?&rdquo;
       her father inquired. The peaches were on the table and the servant had, of
      course, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had nothing to say of interest to me,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, except, of course, that his respectful aspiration to marry you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       suggested Mr. Ayrton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not put the &lsquo;except&rsquo; before that, my papa,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet I have for some years been under the impression that even when a
      man whom she recoils from marrying talks to a young woman about his
      aspirations in the direction of marriage, she is more interested than she
      would be when the man whom she wishes to marry talks on some other topic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate, George Holland didn&rsquo;t interest me so long as he talked of
      his aspirations. Then he talked of&mdash;well, of something else, and I&rsquo;m
      afraid that I was rude to him. I don&rsquo;t think that he will come here again.
      I know that I shall never go to St. Chad&rsquo;s again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens above! This is a pretty story to tell a father. How were you rude
      to him? I should like to have a story of your rudeness, merely to hold up
      against you for a future emergency.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I pointed to the door in the attitude of the heroine of one of the old
      plays, and when he didn&rsquo;t leave at once, I left the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean to say that you left him standing in the middle of the room
      while you went away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you that I was rude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rude, yes; but it&rsquo;s one thing to omit to leave cards upon a hostess, and
      quite another to stare her in the face when she bows to you in the street.
      It&rsquo;s one thing to omit sending a man a piece of your bridescake, and quite
      another to knock off his hat in the street. Rude, oh, my dear Phyllis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you knew what he said about&mdash;about someone whom I love&mdash;if
      you knew how angry I was, you would not say that I acted so atrociously,
      after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Did he say something more about Ruth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said too much&mdash;far too much; I cannot tell you. If any other man
      said so much I would treat him in the same way. You must not ask me
      anything further, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rude and unrepentant, shocking and not ashamed. This is terrible. But
      perhaps it&rsquo;s better that you should be rude when you&rsquo;re young and
      beautiful; later on, when you&rsquo;re no longer young, it will not be permitted
      in you. I&rsquo;ll question you no further. Only how about Sunday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have promised Ella to go with her party to The Mooring for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will get over the matter of the church, but only for one Sunday. How
      about the next Sundays&mdash;until the prorogation? Now, don&rsquo;t say the
      obvious &lsquo;sufficient unto the Sunday is the sermon thereof.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly will not. I have done forever with St. Chad&rsquo;s, unless the
      bishop interferes and we get a new rector.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s settled. And so we can drink our coffee in the drawing room
      with easy minds. Rude! Great Heavens!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXVII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THAT&rsquo;S WHY WOMEN DO NOT MAKE GOOD PHILOSOPHERS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      She had prayed to God that he might be kept away from her; but immediately
      afterward, as has already been stated, when she began to think over the
      situation of the hour, she came to the conclusion that she had been a
      little too precipitate in her petition. She felt that she would like to
      ask him how it had come about that he had played that contemptible part.
      Such a contemptible part! Was it on record, she wondered, that any man had
      ever played that contemptible part? To run away! And she had designed and
      worn that wonderful toilet; such a toilet as Helen might have worn (she
      thought); such a toilet as Cleopatra might have worn (she fancied); such a
      toilet as&mdash;as Sarah Bernhardt (she was certain) would wear when
      impersonating a woman who had lost her soul for the love of a man. Oh, had
      ever woman been so humiliated! She thought of the way Sarah Bernhardt
      would act the part of one of those women if her lover had run away from
      her outstretched arms,&mdash;and such a toilet,&mdash;only it was not on
      record that the lover of any one of them had ever run away. The lovers had
      been only too faithful; they had remained to be hacked to pieces with a
      mediaeval knife sparkling with jewels, or to swallow some curious poison
      out of a Byzantine goblet. She would have a word or two to say to Herbert
      Courtland when he returned. She would create the part of the woman whose
      lover has humiliated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was her thought until her husband told her that he had sent that
      letter to Herbert Courtland, and he would most likely dine with them on
      the evening of his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was it occurred to her that Herbert Courtland might by some
      curious mischance&mdash;mischances occurred in many of Sarah Bernhardt&rsquo;s
      plays&mdash;have come to hear that she had paid that rather singular visit
      to Phyllis Ayrton, just at the hour that she had named in that letter
      which she had written to him. What difference did that make in regard to
      his unparalleled flight? He was actually aboard the yacht <i>Water Nymph</i>
      before she had rung for her brougham to take her to Phyllis&rsquo;. He had been
      the first to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she began to think, as she had thought once before, of her husband&rsquo;s
      sudden return,&mdash;the return of a husband at the exact hour named in
      the letter to a lover was by no means an unknown incident in a play of
      Sarah Bernhardt&rsquo;s,&mdash;and before she had continued upon this course of
      thought for many minutes, she had come to the conclusion that she would
      not be too hard on Herbert Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not too hard on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an interview with Mr. Linton at the city offices of the great
      Taragonda Creek Mine. (The mine had, as has already been stated, been
      discovered by Herbert Courtland during his early explorations in
      Australia, and he had acquired out of his somewhat slender resources&mdash;he
      had been poor in those days&mdash;about a square mile of the wretched
      country where it was situated, and had then communicated his discovery to
      Stephen Linton, who understood the science and arts necessary for
      utilizing such a discovery, the result being that in two years everyone
      connected with the Taragonda Mine was rich. The sweepings of the crushing
      rooms were worth twenty thousand pounds a year: and Herbert Courtland had
      spent about ten thousand pounds&mdash;a fourth of his year&rsquo;s income&mdash;in
      the quest of the meteor-bird to make a feather fan for Ella Linton.) And
      when the business for which he had been summoned to London had been set <i>en
      train</i>, he had paid a visit to his publishers. (They wondered could he
      give them a novel on New Guinea. If he introduced plenty of dialect and it
      was sufficiently unintelligible it might thrust the kail yard out of the
      market; but the novel must be in dialect, they assured him.) After
      promising to give the matter his attention, he paid his visit to Phyllis,
      and then went to his rooms to dress; for when Stephen Linton had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll dine with us to-night: I told Ella you would come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had said, &ldquo;Thanks; I shall be very pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come early; eight sharp,&rdquo; Mr. Linton had added.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus it was that at five minutes to eight o&rsquo;clock Herbert found
      himself face to face alone with the woman whom he had so grossly
      humiliated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps she was hard on him after all: she addressed him as Mr. Courtland.
      She felt that she, at any rate, had returned to the straight path of duty
      when she had done that. (It was Herbert Courtland who had talked to
      Phyllis of the modern philosopher&mdash;a political philosopher or a
      philosophical politician&mdash;who, writing against compromise, became the
      leading exponent of that science, and had hoped to solve the question of a
      Deity by using a small g in spelling God. On the same principle Ella had
      called Herbert &ldquo;Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt uneasy. Was he ashamed of himself, she wondered?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen will be down in a moment, Mr. Courtland,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to hear it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How warm it has been all day!&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;I thought of you toiling away
      over figures in the city, when you might have been breathing the lovely
      air of the sea. It was too bad of Stephen to bring you back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you I was glad to get his letter at Leith,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was
      thinking for the two days previous how I could best concoct a telegram to
      myself at Leith in order that I might have some excuse for running away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is assuming that running away needs some excuse,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a considerable pause before he said, in a low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella, Ella, I know everything&mdash;that night. We were saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mr. Linton entered the room. He was, after all, not late,
      he said: it wanted a minute still of being eight o&rsquo;clock. He had just been
      at the telephone to receive a reply regarding a box at Covent Garden. In
      the earlier part of the day none had been vacant, he had been told; but
      the people at the box office promised to telephone to him if any became
      vacant in the course of the afternoon. He had just come from the
      telephone, and had secured a good enough box on the first tier. He hoped
      that Ella would not mind &ldquo;Carmen&rdquo;; there was to be a new <i>Carmen</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella assured him that she could not fail to be interested in any <i>Carmen</i>,
      new or old. It was so good of him to take all that trouble for her,
      knowing how devoted she was to opera. She hoped that Herbert&mdash;she
      called him Herbert in the presence of her husband&mdash;was in a <i>Carmen</i>
      mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always in a mood to study anything that&rsquo;s unreservedly savage,&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much reservation about our little friend <i>Carmen</i>,&rdquo; said
      Mr. Linton. &ldquo;She tells you her philosophy in her first moment before you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hummed the habanera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are: <i>Misteroso e l&rsquo;amore</i>&mdash;that&rsquo;s the philosophy of
      your pretty savage, Herbert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Herbert; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s that philosophy which consists in an absence of
      philosophy&mdash;not the worst kind, either, it seems to me. It&rsquo;s the
      philosophy of impulse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought that the aim of all philosophy was to check every impulse,&rdquo;
       said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is; that&rsquo;s why women do not make good philosophers,&rdquo; said her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or, for that matter, good mothers of philosophers,&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a hard saying, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as transparent as air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;London air in November?&rdquo; suggested her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means that there&rsquo;s no such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As air in London in November? I&rsquo;m with him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He means that there&rsquo;s no such thing as a good philosopher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hope he has an appetite for dinner. The man without philosophy
      usually has.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The butler had just announced dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much talk among them of philosophy so long as the footmen
      were floating round them like mighty tropical birds. They talked of the
      House of Commons instead. A new measure was to be introduced the next
      night: something that threatened beer and satisfied no party; not even the
      teetotalers&mdash;only the wives of the teetotalers. Then they had a few
      words regarding George Holland&rsquo;s article in the <i>Zeit Geist</i>. Mr.
      Linton seemed to some extent interested in the contentions of the rector
      of St. Chad&rsquo;s; and Herbert agreed with him when he expressed the opinion
      that the two greatest problems that the Church had to face were: How to
      get people with intelligence to go to church, and what to do with them
      when they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an hour they were in their box at Covent Garden listening to the
      sensuous music of &ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; and comparing the sauciness of the charming
      little devil who sang the habanera, with the piquancy of the last <i>Carmen</i>
      but three, and with the refinement of the one who had made so great a
      success at Munich. They agreed that the savagery of the newest was very
      fascinating,&mdash;Stephen Linton called it womanly,&mdash;but they
      thought they should like to hear her in the third act before pronouncing a
      definite opinion regarding her capacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the husband left the box to talk to some people who were seated
      opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know everything?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said Herbert. &ldquo;Can you ever forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For running away? Oh, Bertie, you cannot have heard all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For forcing you to write me that letter&mdash;can you ever forgive me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the letter? Oh, Bertie, we were both wrong&mdash;terribly wrong. But
      we were saved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, we were saved. Thank God&mdash;thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my first cry, Bertie, when I felt that I was safe&mdash;that we
      both had been saved: Thank God! It seemed as if a miracle had been done to
      save us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it was&mdash;a miracle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I spent the night praying that you might be kept away from me, Bertie&mdash;away
      for ever and ever. I felt that I was miserably weak; I felt that I could
      not trust myself; but now that you are here beside me again I feel strong.
      Oh, Bertie, we know ourselves better now than we did a week ago&mdash;is
      it only a week ago? It seems months&mdash;years&mdash;a lifetime!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think that we know each other better now, Ella. That night aboard
      the yacht all the history of the past six months seemed to come before me.
      I saw what a wretch I had been, and I was overwhelmed with self-contempt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all my fault, dear Bertie. I was foolish&mdash;vain&mdash;a mere
      woman! Do not say that I did not take pride in what I called, in my secret
      moments, my conquest. Oh, Bertie! I had sunk into the depths. And then
      that letter! But we were saved, and I feel that we have been saved
      forevermore. I feel strong by your side now. And you, I know, feel strong,
      Bertie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have awakened from my dream, Ella. You called her your good angel too.
      Surely it was my good angel that sent me to her that evening!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella was staring at him. He said that he knew everything. It appeared that
      she was the one who was not in the fortunate position of knowing all.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Phyllis Ayrton&mdash;you were with her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For half an hour. She was unconscious of the effect her words had upon
      me,&mdash;the words of another woman,&mdash;leading me back to the side of
      those who have gone forever. I listened to her, and then it was that I
      awoke. She did not know. How could she tell that the light of heaven was
      breaking in upon a soul that was on the brink of hell? She saved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me nothing of that.&rdquo; There was a curious eagerness in her voice.
      &ldquo;She told me nothing. Oh, how could she tell me anything? She knew nothing
      of it herself. She looked on you as an ordinary visitor. She told you that
      I fled to her. Oh, Bertie, Bertie! those hours that I passed&mdash;the
      terrible conflict. But when I felt her arms about me I knew that I was
      safe. Then Stephen entered. I thought that we were lost&mdash;you and I;
      that he had returned to find you waiting. I don&rsquo;t know if he had a
      suspicion. At any rate we were saved, and by her&mdash;dear Phyllis. Oh,
      will she ever know, I wonder, what it is to be a woman? Bertie, she is my
      dearest friend&mdash;I told you so. I thought of her and you&mdash;long
      ago. Oh, why should you not think of her now that you have awakened and
      are capable of thought&mdash;the thought of a sane man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat with an elbow resting on the front of the opera box, his head upon
      his hand. He was not looking at her, but beyond her. He seemed to be lost
      in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was he considering that curious doctrine which she had propounded, that if
      a man really loves a woman he will marry her dearest friend? He made no
      reply to her. The point required a good deal of thought, apparently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear me, Bertie&mdash;dear Bertie?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered that, upon a previous occasion, when she had made the same
      suggestion to him, he had put it aside as unworthy of comment&mdash;unworthy
      of a moment&rsquo;s thought. How could it be possible for him, loving her as he
      did, to admit the possibility of another&rsquo;s attractiveness in his eyes? The
      idea had seemed ludicrous to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now he made no such protest. He seemed to consider her suggestion and
      to think it&mdash;well, worthy of consideration; and this should have been
      very pleasing to her; for did it not mean that she had gained her point?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will think over it, Bertie?&rdquo; she said. Her voice was now scarcely so
      full of eagerness as it had been before. Was that because she did not want
      to weary him by her persistence? Even the suggestion to a man that he
      should love a certain woman should, she knew, be made with tact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking over it,&rdquo; he said at last; but only after a long
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am so glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she actually believed that she was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought about her aboard the yacht.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? I fancied that you would think of&mdash;&mdash;But I am so
      glad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of her as my good angel. Those words which she said to me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has been your good angel, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella, Ella, she has been our good angel&mdash;you said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you think that I meant it? Some women&mdash;she is one of them&mdash;are
      born to lead men upward; others&mdash;&mdash;Ah, there, it is on the
      stage: <i>Carmen</i>, the enchantress, <i>Michaela</i>, the good angel.
      But I am so glad! She is coming to stay with us up the river; you must be
      with us too. You cannot possibly know her yet. But a week by her side&mdash;you
      will, I know, come to perceive what she is&mdash;the sweetest&mdash;the
      most perfect!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still he made no reply. He was looking earnestly at the conductor, who was
      pulling his musicians together for the second act.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will come to us, Bertie?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare not promise,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I feel just now like a man who is still
      dazed, on being suddenly awakened. I have not yet begun to see things as
      they are. I am not sure of myself. I will let you know later on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the conductor tapped his desk, and those of the audience who had left
      their places returned. Stephen Linton slipped into his chair; his wife
      took up her lorgnette as the first jingle of the tambourines was heard,
      and the curtain rose upon the picturesque tawdriness of the company
      assembled at the <i>Senor Lois Pastia&rsquo;s</i> place of entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella gave all her attention to the opera&mdash;to that tragedy of the
      weakness of the flesh, albeit the spirit may be willing to listen to good.
      Alas! that the flesh should be so full of color and charm and seduction,
      while the spirit is pale, colorless, and set to music in a minor key!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Carmen</i> flashed about the stage under the brilliant lights, looking
      like a lovely purple butterfly&mdash;a lovely purple oriole endowed with
      the double glory of plumage and song, and men whose hearts beat in unison
      with the heart-beats of that sensuous music through which she expressed
      herself, loved her; watched her with ravished eyes; heard her with
      ravished ears&mdash;yes, as men love such women; until the senses recover
      from the intoxication of her eyes and her limbs and her voice. And in the
      third act the sweet <i>Michaela</i> came on with her song of the delight
      of purity, and peace, and home. She sang it charmingly, everyone allowed,
      and hoped that <i>Carmen</i> would sing as well in the last act as she had
      sung in the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella Linton kept her eyes fixed upon the stage to the very end of all.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CHURCH IS NOT NEUROTIC.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When George Holland received his two letters and read them he laid them
      side by side and asked himself what each of them meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he could make a pretty good guess as to what the bishop&rsquo;s meant. The
      bishop meant business. But what did Mr. Linton want with him? Mr. Linton
      was a business man, perhaps he meant business too. Business men
      occasionally mean business; they more frequently only pretend to do so, in
      order to put off their guard the men they are trying to get the better of.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have an interview with the bishop; so much was certain; and that
      interview was bound to be a difficult one&mdash;for the bishop. It was
      with some degree of pride that he anticipated the conflict. He would
      withdraw nothing that he had written. Let all the forces of the earth be
      leagued against him, he would abate not a jot&mdash;not a jot. (By the
      forces of the earth he meant the Bench of Bishops, which was scarcely
      doing justice to the bishops&mdash;or to the forces of the earth.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they might deprive him of his living, but that would make no
      difference to him. Not a jot&mdash;not a jot! They might persecute him to
      the death. He would be faithful unto death to the truths he had endeavored
      to spread abroad. He felt that they were truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that other letter, which also asked for an interview at his earliest
      convenience the next day, was rather more puzzling to George Holland. He
      had never had any but the most casual acquaintance with Mr. Linton&mdash;such
      an acquaintance as one has with one&rsquo;s host at a house where one has
      occasionally dined. He had dined at Mr. Linton&rsquo;s house more than once; but
      then he had been seated in such proximity to Mrs. Linton as necessitated
      his remoteness from Mr. Linton. Therefore he had never had a chance of
      becoming intimate with that gentleman. Why, then, should that gentleman
      desire an early interview with him?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly curious that within a few minutes of his having referred
      to Mrs. Linton, in the presence of Phyllis Ayrton, in a way that had had a
      very unhappy result so far as he was concerned, he should receive a letter
      from Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s husband asking for an early interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself in his study chair and began to think what the writer of
      that letter might have to say to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not to ask himself if it was possible that Mr. Linton might have a
      word or two to say to him, respecting the word or two which he, George
      Holland, had just said about Mrs. Linton; for George knew very well that,
      though during the previous week or two he had heard some persons speaking
      lightly of Mrs. Linton, coupling her name with the name of Herbert
      Courtland, yet he had never had occasion to couple their names together
      except during the previous half hour, so that it could not be Mr. Linton&rsquo;s
      intention to take him to task, so to speak, for his indiscretion&mdash;his
      slander, Phyllis might be disposed to term it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that point he was entirely satisfied. But he was not certain that Mr.
      Linton did not want to consult him on some matter having more or less
      direct bearing upon the coupling together of the names of Mrs. Linton and
      Mr. Courtland. People even in town are fond of consulting clergymen upon
      curious personal matters&mdash;matters upon which a lawyer or a doctor
      should rather be consulted. He himself had never encouraged such
      confidences. What did he keep curates for? His curates had saved him many
      a long hour of talk with inconsequent men and illogical women who had come
      to him with their stories. What were to him the stories of men whose wives
      were giving them trouble? What were to him the stories of wives who had
      difficulties with their housemaids or who could not keep their boys from
      reading pirate literature? His curates managed the domestic department of
      his church for him. They could give any earnest inquirer at a moment&rsquo;s
      notice the addresses of several civil-spoken women (elderly) who went out
      as mother&rsquo;s helps by the day. They were very useful young men and
      professed to like this work. He would not do them the injustice to believe
      that they spoke the truth in that particular way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not fancy for what purpose Mr. Linton wished to see him. But he
      made up his mind that, if Mr. Linton was anxious that his wife should be
      remonstrated with, he, George Holland, would decline to accept the duty of
      remonstrating with her. He was wise enough to know that he did not know
      very much about womankind; but he knew too much to suppose that there is
      any more thankless employment than remonstrating with an extremely pretty
      woman on any subject, but particularly on the subject of a very
      distinguished man to whom she considers herself bound by ties of the
      truest friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then there came upon him with the force of a great shock the
      recollection of what Phyllis had said to him on this very point:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>If Ella Linton were wicked, you should be held responsible for it in
      the sight of God</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those were her words, and those words cut asunder the last strand of
      whatever tie there had been between him and Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      His duty as a clergyman intrusted with the care of the souls of the
      people, he had neglected that, she declared with startling vehemence. He
      had been actuated by vanity in publishing his book&mdash;his article in
      the <i>Zeit Geist Review</i>&mdash;she had said so; but there she had been
      wrong. He felt that she had done him a great injustice in that particular
      statement, and he tried to make his sense of this injustice take the place
      of the uneasy feeling of which he was conscious, when he thought over her
      other words. He knew that he was not actuated by vanity in adopting the
      bold course that was represented by his writings. He honestly believed
      that his efforts were calculated to work a great reform in the Church. If
      not in the Church, outside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his duty in regard to the souls of the people&mdash;&mdash;Oh! it was
      the merest sophistry to assume that such responsibility on the part of a
      clergyman is susceptible of being particularized. It should, he felt, be
      touched upon, if at all, in a very general way. Did that young woman
      expect that he should preach a sermon to suit the special case of every
      individual soul intrusted (according to her absurd theory) to his keeping?
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was preposterous; it could not be seriously considered for a
      moment. She had allowed herself to be carried away by her affection for
      her friend to make accusations against him, in which even she herself
      would not persist in her quieter moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found it quite easy to prove that Phyllis had been in the wrong and
      that he was in the right; but this fact did not prevent an intermittent
      recurrence during the evening of that feeling of uneasiness, as those
      words of the girl, &ldquo;<i>If Ella Linton were wicked, you would be held
      responsible for it in the sight of God</i>,&rdquo; buzzed in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would she have me become an ordinary clergyman of the Church of England?&rdquo;
       he cried indignantly, as he switched on the light in his bedroom shortly
      before midnight&mdash;for the rushlight in the cell of the modern man of
      God is supplied at a strength of so many volts. &ldquo;Would she have me become
      the model country parson, preaching to the squire and other yokels on
      Sunday, and chatting about their souls to wheezy Granfer this, and Gammer
      that?&rdquo; He had read the works of Mr. Thomas Hardy. &ldquo;Does she suppose that I
      was made for such a life as that? Poor Phyllis! When will she awake from
      this dream of hers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Did he fancy that he loved her still? or was the pain that he felt, when
      he reflected that he had lost her, the result of his wounded vanity&mdash;the
      result of his feeling that people would say he had not had sufficient
      skill, with all his cleverness, to retain the love of the girl who had
      promised to be his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before going to bed he had written replies to the two letters. The bishop
      had suggested an early hour for their interview&mdash;he had named eleven
      o&rsquo;clock as convenient to himself, if it would also suit Mr. Holland. Two
      o&rsquo;clock was the hour suggested by Mr. Linton, if that hour would not
      interfere with the other engagements of Mr. Holland; so he had written
      agreements to the suggestions of both his correspondents.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven o&rsquo;clock exactly he drove through the gates of the Palace of the
      bishop, and with no faltering hand pulled the bell. (So, he reflected for
      an instant,&mdash;only an instant,&mdash;Luther had gone, somewhere or
      other, he forgot at the moment what was the exact locality; but the
      occasion had been a momentous one in the history of the Church.)
    </p>
    <p>
      He was cordially greeted by the bishop, who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Holland? I took it for granted that you were an early
      riser&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I ventured to name eleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No hour could suit me better to-day,&rdquo; said George, accepting the seat&mdash;he
      perceived at once that it was a genuine Chippendale chair upholstered in
      old red morocco&mdash;to which his lordship made a motion with his hand.
      He did not, however, seat himself until the bishop had occupied, which he
      did very comfortably, the corresponding chair at the side of the study
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was anxious to have a chat with you about that book, and that article
      of yours in the <i>Zeit Geist</i>, Holland,&rdquo; said the bishop. &ldquo;I wish you
      had written neither.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Litera scripta manet</i>,&rdquo; said George, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      One may quote Latin in conversation with a bishop without being thought a
      prig. In a letter to the <i>Times</i> and in conversation with a bishop
      are the only two occasions in these unclassical days when one may safely
      quote Latin or Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rdquo; said the prelate, with a shake of his head that
      was Early Norman. &ldquo;Yes, you see a book isn&rsquo;t like a sermon. People don&rsquo;t
      remember a man&rsquo;s sermons against him nowadays; they do his books,
      however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite ready to accept the conditions of modern life, my lord,&rdquo; said
      George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was anxious to give you my opinion as early as possible,&rdquo; resumed the
      bishop, &ldquo;and that is, that what you have just published&mdash;the book and
      the <i>Zeit Geist</i> article&mdash;reflect&mdash;yes, in no
      inconsiderable measure&mdash;what I have long thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am flattered, indeed, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not be, Holland. I believe that there are a large number of
      thinking men in the Church who are trying to solve the problem with which
      you have so daringly grappled&mdash;the problem of how to induce
      intellectual men and women to attend the services of the church. I&rsquo;m
      afraid that there is a great deal of truth in what you say about the
      Church herself bearing responsibility for the existence of this problem.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no setting aside that fact, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! that short-sighted policy has been the Church&rsquo;s greatest enemy from
      the earliest period. You remember what St. Augustine says? Ah, never mind
      just now. About your book&mdash;that&rsquo;s the matter before us just now. I
      must say that I don&rsquo;t consider the present time the most suitable for the
      issue of that book, or that article in the <i>Zeit Geist</i>. You meant
      them to be startling. Well, they are startling. There are some complaints&mdash;nervous
      complaints&mdash;that require to be startled out of the system; that&rsquo;s a
      phrase of Sir Richard&rsquo;s. He made use of it in regard to my neuralgia. &lsquo;We
      must surprise it out of the system,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;with a large dose of
      quinine.&rsquo; The phrase seemed to me to be a very striking one. But the
      Church is not neurotic. You cannot apply the surprise method to her system
      with any chance of success. That is wherein the publication of your
      article seems to me to be&mdash;shall we call it premature? It is
      calculated to startle; but you cannot startle people into going to church,
      my dear Holland, and that is, of course, the only object you hope to
      achieve. Your book and your article were written with the sole object of
      bringing intelligent people to church. But it occurs to me, and I think it
      will occur to you also, that if the article be taken seriously,&mdash;and
      it is meant to be taken seriously,&mdash;it may be the means of keeping
      people away from the Church rather than bringing them to church. It may
      even be the means of alienating from that fond, if somewhat foolish old
      mother of ours, many of her children who are already attached to her. I
      trust I don&rsquo;t speak harshly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lordship speaks most kindly; but the truth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should be spoken as gently as possible when it is calculated to wound,
      Holland; that is why I trust I am speaking gently now. Ah, Holland! there
      are the little children to be considered as well as the Scribes and
      Pharisees. There are weaker brethren. You have heard of the necessity for
      considering the weaker brethren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seem to have heard of nothing else since I entered the Church; all the
      brethren are the weaker brethren.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are; I am one of the weaker brethren myself. It is all a question of
      comparison. I don&rsquo;t say that your article is likely to have the effect of
      causing me to join the band of non-church-goers. I don&rsquo;t at this moment
      believe that it will drive me to golf instead of Gospel; but I honestly do
      believe that it is calculated to do that to hundreds of persons who just
      now require but the smallest grain of argument to turn the balance of
      their minds in favor of golf. Your aim was not in that direction, I&rsquo;m
      sure, Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My aim was to speak the truth, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In order to achieve a noble object&mdash;the gathering of the stragglers
      into the fold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was my motive, my lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You announce boldly that this old mother of ours is in a moribund
      condition, in order that you may gather in as many of her scattered
      children as possible to stand at her bedside? Ah, my dear Holland! the
      moribund brings together the wolves and the vultures and all unclean,
      hungry things to try and get a mouthful off those prostrate limbs of hers&mdash;a
      mouthful while her flesh is still warm. I tell you this&mdash;I who have
      from time to time during the last fifty years heard the howl of the hyena,
      seen the talons of the vulture at the door of her chamber. They fancied
      that the end could not be far off, that no more strength was left in that
      aged body that lay prone for the moment. But I have heard the howling wane
      into the distance and get lost in the outer darkness when the old Church
      roused herself and went forth to face the snarling teeth&mdash;the eager
      talons. There is life in this mighty old mother of ours still. New life
      comes to her, not as it did to the fabled hero of old, by contact with the
      earth, but by communing with heaven. The bark of the wolf, the snarl of
      the hyena, may be heard in the debate which the Government have encouraged
      in the House of Commons on the Church. Philistia rejoices. Let the movers
      in this obscene tumult look to themselves. Have they the confidence of the
      people even as the Church has that confidence? Let them put it to the
      test. I tell you, George Holland, the desert and the ditch, whose vomit
      those men are who now move against us in Parliament, shall receive them
      once more before many months have passed. The Church on whom they hoped to
      prey shall witness their dispersal, never again to return. I know the
      signs. I know what the present silence throughout the country means. The
      champion of God and the Church has drawn his breath for the conflict. His
      teeth are set&mdash;his weapon is in his hand&mdash;you will see the
      result within a year. We shall have a government in power, a government
      whose power will not be dependent on the faddists and the self-seekers&mdash;the
      ignorant, the blatant bellowers of pitiful platitudes, the platform
      loafers who call themselves labor-leaders, but whom the real laborers
      repudiate. Mark my words, their doom is sealed; back to the desert and the
      ditch! My dear Holland, pardon this digression. I feel that I need say
      nothing more to you than I have already said. The surprise system of
      therapeutics is not suited to the existing ailments of the Church. Caution
      is what is needed if you would not defeat your own worthy object, which, I
      know, is to give fresh vitality to the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is certainly my object, my lord; only let me say that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Holland, I will not let you say anything. I asked you to come
      here this morning in order that you might hear me. That is all that is
      necessary for the present. Perhaps, upon some future occasion, I may have
      the privilege of hearing you in a discourse of some greater length than
      that which I have just inflicted upon you. I have given you my candid
      opinion of your writings, and you know that is the opinion of a man who
      has but one object in life&mdash;you know that it is the opinion of an old
      man who has seen the beginning and the end of many movements in society
      and in the Church, and who has learned that the Church, for all her
      decrepitude, is yet the most stable thing that the world has seen. I have
      to thank you for coming to me, Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your lordship has spoken to me with the greatest kindness,&rdquo; said George
      Holland, as his spiritual father offered him his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he was in his hansom once more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I KNOW THAT IT DOESN&rsquo;T MATTER MUCH TO GOD WHAT A MAN THINKS ABOUT HIMSELF
      OR HIS SOUL.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next hour and a half the Rev. George Holland had an opportunity of
      considering his position as a clergyman of the Church of England, and as
      one whose chief desire was to advance the interests of the Church. His
      bishop had assumed that he had been single-minded in his aims&mdash;that
      his sole object in writing that book and that paper had been to cure the
      complaint from which the old Church was suffering. His lordship had done
      him justice where Phyllis had done him a gross injustice. What would
      Phyllis have said he wondered, if she had heard that concession, made not
      under pressure, but voluntarily by probably the highest authority in the
      world, to his, George Holland&rsquo;s, singleness of aim?
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was so like a girl to jump at conclusions&mdash;to assume that he
      had been actuated by vanity in all that he had just done; that he was
      desirous only of getting people to talk about him&mdash;being regardless
      whether they spoke well of him or ill. He only wished that she could have
      heard the bishop. He felt as a man feels whose character has just been
      cleared in a court of law from an aspersion that has rested on it for some
      time. He wondered if that truly noble man whom he was privileged to call
      his Father in God, would have any objection to give him a testimonial to
      the effect that in his opinion,&mdash;the opinion of his Father in God,&mdash;there
      was no foundation for the accusation against him and his singleness of
      aim.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the bishop knew that it was not vanity which had urged him to write
      what he had written. The bishop understood men.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right; the bishop understood men so well as to be able to produce
      in a few words upon the man who had just visited the palace, the
      impression that he believed that that man had been impelled by a strong
      sense of duty without a touch of vanity. He understood man so well as to
      cause that same visitor of his to make a resolution never again to publish
      anything in the same strain as the <i>Zeit Geist</i> article, without
      first consulting with the bishop. George Holland had pulled the bell at
      the palace gates with the hand of a Luther; but he had left the presence
      of the bishop with the step of a Francis of Assisi. He felt that anyone
      who would voluntarily give pain to so gentle a man as the bishop could
      only be a brute. He even felt that the bishop had shown himself to be his,
      George Holland&rsquo;s superior in judgment and in the methods which he
      employed. The bishop was not an overrated man.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a full hour in the silence and solitude of the reading room of his
      club he reflected upon the excellence of the bishop, and it was with a
      sign of regret that he rose to keep his other appointment. He would have
      liked to continue for another hour or two doing justice to that good man
      out of whose presence he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Linton&rsquo;s office was not quite in the City. Twenty minutes drive
      brought George Holland into the private room of Ella Linton&rsquo;s husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very good of you to come to me, Mr. Holland,&rdquo; said Stephen. &ldquo;There
      seems to be a general idea that a clergyman should be at the beck and call
      of everyone who has a whim to&mdash;what do they call it in Ireland&mdash;to
      make his soul? That has never been my opinion; I have never given any
      trouble to a clergyman since I was at school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the privilege of a minister to be a servant,&rdquo; said the Rev. George
      Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were taught that at school&mdash;in connection with the Latin verb <i>ministro</i>,&rdquo;
       said Mr. Linton. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Holland, I am glad that you take such a view
      of your calling, for I am anxious that you should do me a great service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Holland bent his head. He wondered if Mr. Linton wished to intrust
      him with the duty of observing his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is, Mr. Holland,&rdquo; resumed Stephen Linton, &ldquo;I have read your book
      and your paper in that review. The way you deal with a difficult question
      has filled me with admiration. You will, I need scarcely say, be outside
      the Church before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot allow you to assume that, Mr. Linton,&rdquo; said George gravely. &ldquo;I
      should be sorry to leave the Church. I cannot see that my leaving it is
      the logical sequence of anything that I have yet written. My aim is, as
      doubtless you have perceived, to bring about such reasonable and, after
      all, not radical changes in the Church system as shall make her in the
      future a more potent agency for good than she has ever yet been, splendid
      though her services to humanity have been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still you will find yourself outside the walls of your Church, Mr.
      Holland. And you will probably adopt the course which other sons of the
      Church have thought necessary to pursue when the stubborn old thing
      refused to be reformed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you suggest that I shall become a Dissenter, Mr. Linton&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggest nothing of the sort, though you dissent already from a good
      many of the fundamental practices of the Church, if I may be permitted the
      expression. Now, I should like to make a provision for your future, Mr.
      Holland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, such a proposition seems to me to be a most extraordinary
      one. I hope you will not think me rude in saying so much. I have not
      suggested, Mr. Linton, as other clergymen might, that you mean an affront
      to me, but I don&rsquo;t think that anything would be gained by prolonging&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to continue, and perhaps you may get a glimmer of gain. Mr.
      Holland, I am what people usually term a doomed man. So far as I can
      gather I have only about six months longer to live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Merciful Heaven!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps it is merciful on the part of Heaven to destroy a man when he has
      reached the age of forty. We&rsquo;ll not go into that question just now. I was
      warned by a doctor two years ago that I had not long to live. It appears
      that my heart was never really a heart&mdash;that is to say, it may have
      had its affections, its emotions, its passions, but pneumatically it is a
      failure; it was never a blood-pump. Six months ago I was examined by the
      greatest authority in Europe, and he pronounced my doom. Three days ago I
      went to the leading specialist in London, and he told me I might with care
      live six months longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Linton, with what words can I express to you my deep feeling
      for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George Holland spoke after a prolonged pause, during which he stared at
      the white-faced man before him. A smile was upon that white face. George
      was deeply affected. He seemed to have stepped out of a world of visions&mdash;a
      world that had a visionary Church, visionary preachers, visionary
      doctrines&mdash;all unsubstantial as words, which are but breath&mdash;into
      a world of realities&mdash;such realities as life and death and&mdash;&mdash;Ah,
      there were no other realities in existence but the two: life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Linton continued smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may gather that I wrote to you in order that you may help me to make
      my soul. What a capital phrase! I didn&rsquo;t do that, Mr. Holland. I have
      never been sanguine about man and his soul. I know that it doesn&rsquo;t matter
      much to God what a man thinks about himself or his soul. It really doesn&rsquo;t
      matter much whether he believes or not that he has a soul: God is the
      Principle of Right&mdash;the Fountain of Justice, and I&rsquo;m willing to trust
      myself to God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true religion, Mr. Linton,&rdquo; said the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I agree with those people who think that the world cannot get on
      without a Church. Now, I am sanguine enough to believe that a Church
      founded on your ideas of what is orthodox would be the means of doing a
      great deal of good. It would do a great deal of good to my wife, to start
      with. She does not know that she is so soon to be a widow. Were she to
      know, the last months of my life would be miserable to both of us. I have
      noticed with some pain, or should I say amusement? perhaps that word would
      be the better&mdash;I have noticed, I say, that her life is one of
      complete aimlessness, and that, therefore, she is tempted to think too
      much about herself. She is also tempted to have longings for&mdash;well,
      for temptation. Ah, she is a woman and temptation is in the way of women.
      <i>Qui parle d&rsquo;amour, fait l&rsquo;amour</i>: temptation comes to the woman who
      thinks about being tempted. Now, I want to give her something to think
      about that shall lead her out of the thoughts of temptation which I
      suppose come naturally to a daughter of Eve&mdash;the first woman who
      thought about temptation and was therefore tempted. My wife is a perfectly
      good woman, and you will be surprised to find out when I am dead how fond
      of me she was&mdash;she will be the most surprised of all. But she is a
      woman. If she were not so much of a woman I don&rsquo;t suppose I should ever
      have cared so much for her as I do. I cared so much for her, Mr. Holland,
      that I remained away from her in Paris for three months so that I might
      school myself to my fate, making no sign that would lead her to suspect
      the truth. Why should she have six months&rsquo; additional misery? I have
      strayed. The Church. I want to give my wife an aim in life; to make her
      feel that she is doing something worthy&mdash;to keep her from thinking of
      less worthy things. Now, I think you will agree with me that there is
      nothing women are really so fond of as a Church of some sort. To be devout
      is as much a part of a woman&rsquo;s disposition as to love&mdash;the passion of
      devoutness sometimes takes the place of the passion of love in her nature.
      Now, I want to give her this idea of a Church to work out when I am dead.
      I want you to carry out as joint trustee with her your theories in regard
      to the ritual, the art, the sermon; and for this purpose I should of
      course provide an ample endowment&mdash;say three or four thousand a year;
      anything you may suggest: I shall leave a great deal of money behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your project startles me, Mr. Linton,&rdquo; said George Holland. &ldquo;It startles
      me as greatly as the first revelation you made to me did. They may be
      mistaken&mdash;the doctors; I have known cases where the highest
      authorities were ludicrously in error. Let us hope that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we may hope; I may live long enough to lay the foundation stone of
      the Church myself. But I am most anxious that you should give the whole
      matter your earnest attention.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite dazed. Do you suggest that I should leave the Church of
      England?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means. That is a question which I leave entirely to your own
      decision. My own idea is that you would like a free hand. You will have to
      leave the Church sooner or later. A man with your advanced ideas cannot
      regulate your pace to that of an old woman. In twenty years the Church
      will think precisely as you think to-day. That is the way with the Church.
      It opposes everything in the way of an innovation. You stated the case
      very fairly in your paper. The Church opposes every discovery and every
      new thing as long as possible. It then only accepts grudgingly what all
      civilization has accepted cordially. Oh, yes, you&rsquo;ll find it impossible to
      remain in the Church, Mr. Holland. &lsquo;Crabbed age and youth,&rsquo; you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should part from the Church with the greatest reluctance, Mr. Linton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t part from it, only don&rsquo;t place yourself in its power. Don&rsquo;t be
      beholden to it for your income. Don&rsquo;t go to the heads of the Church for
      orders. Be your own master and in plain words, run the concern on your own
      lines. The widow of the founder will have no power to interfere with you
      in the matter of such arrangements.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have to give the matter a good deal of thought. I should
      naturally have to reform a good deal of the ritual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Naturally. The existing ritual is only a compromise. And as for the hymns
      which are sung, why is it necessary for them to be doggerel before they
      are devotional?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hymns are for the most part doggerel. We should have a first-rate
      choir and anthems&mdash;not necessarily taken from the Bible. Why should
      not Shakspere be sung in churches&mdash;Shakspere&rsquo;s divine poetry instead
      of the nonsense-rhymes that people call hymns? Shakspere and Milton;
      Shelley I would not debar; Wordsworth&rsquo;s sonnets. But the scheme will
      require a great deal of thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal; that is why I leave it in your hands. You are a thinking
      man&mdash;you are not afraid of tradition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tradition&mdash;tradition! the ruts made in the road by the vehicles that
      have passed over it in years gone by!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The road to the Church is sadly in need of macadamizing, Mr. Holland&mdash;or,
      better still, asphalting. Make a bicycle road of it, and you are all
      right. Now, come with me to my club and have lunch. We&rsquo;ll talk no more
      just now about this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went out together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THERE IS NO ONE I LIKE BETTER THAN PHYLLIS.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Phyllis Ayrton had spent a considerable time pondering over that problem
      of how best to save a man and a woman from destruction&mdash;social,
      perhaps; eternal, for certain. She felt that it had been laid upon her to
      save them both, and she remembered the case of one Jonah, a prophet, who,
      in endeavoring to escape from the disagreeable duty with which he had been
      intrusted, had had an experience that was practically unique, even among
      prophets. She would not try to evade her responsibility in this matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days after Herbert Courtland had witnessed by the side of Ella the
      representation of &ldquo;Carmen,&rdquo; he had met Phyllis at an At Home. He had seen
      her in the distance through a vista of crowded rooms, and had crushed his
      way to her side. He could scarcely fail to see the little light that came
      to her face as she put out her hand to him, nor could her companion of the
      moment&mdash;he was one of the coming men in science, consequently like
      most coming men, he had been forced into a prominent place in the drawing
      room&mdash;fail to perceive that his farewell moment with that pretty Miss
      Ayrton had come. She practically turned her back upon him when Herbert
      Courtland came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments they chatted together, and then it occurred to him that
      she might like some iced coffee. His surmise proved correct, and as there
      was at that moment a stream of people endeavoring to avoid the
      entertainment of the high-class pianoforte player which was threatened in
      a neighboring apartment, Phyllis and her companion had no trouble in
      slipping aside from the panic-stricken people into the tea room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a sultry day, and the French windows of the room were open. It was
      Phyllis who discovered that there was a narrow veranda, with iron-work
      covered with creepers, running halfway round the house from window to
      window; and when he suggested to her that they might drink their coffee on
      this veranda, she hailed the suggestion as a very happy one. How did it
      come that none of the rest of the people had thought of that? she
      wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another instant they were standing together at the space between the
      windows outside, the long-leaved creepers mingling with the decorations of
      her hat, and making a very effective background for his well-shaped head.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next half-hour people were intermittently coming to one of the
      windows, putting their heads out and then turning away, the girls with
      gentle little pursings of the mouth and other forms that the sneer
      feminine assumes; the men with winks and an occasional chuckle, suggestive
      of an exchange of confidence too deep for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      One woman had poked her head out&mdash;it was gray at the roots and golden
      at the tips&mdash;and asked her companion in a voice that had a large
      circumference where was Mrs. Linton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Herbert Courtland had not lived so long far from the busy haunts of
      men (white) as to be utterly ignorant of the fact that no young woman but
      one who is disposed to be quite friendly with a man, would adopt such a
      suggestion as he had made to her, and spend half an hour drinking half a
      cup of iced coffee by his side in that particular place. The particular
      place might have accommodated six persons; but he knew, and he knew that
      she knew also, that it was one of the unwritten laws of good society that
      such particular places are overcrowded if occupied by three persons. It
      was on this account the old men and maidens and the young men and matrons&mdash;that
      is how they pair themselves nowadays&mdash;had avoided the veranda so
      carefully, refusing to contribute to its congestion as a place of resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Courtland could not but feel that Phyllis intended to be friendly
      with him&mdash;even at the risk of being within audible distance of the
      strong man who was fighting a duel <i>a outrance</i> with a grand piano;
      and as he desired to be on friendly terms with a girl in whom he was
      greatly interested, he was very much pleased to find her showing no
      disposition to return to the tea room, or any other room, until quite half
      an hour had gone by very pleasantly. And then she did so with a start: the
      start of a girl who suddenly remembers a duty&mdash;and regrets it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That had pleased him greatly; he felt it to be rather a triumph for him
      that by his side she had not only forgotten her duty but was glad she had
      forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; she said, in answer to his question, &ldquo;I have two other places
      to go to. I&rsquo;m so sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry that you remembered them?&rdquo; he had suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would happen if&mdash;I had continued forgetting them?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the most interesting question I have heard in some time. Why not
      try to continue forgetting them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too great a coward,&rdquo; she replied, putting out her hand to him, for
      now her victoria had drawn up and the footman was standing ready to open
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! only <i>au revoir</i>,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart&mdash;<i>au revoir</i> at The Mooring,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      That <i>au revoir</i> had reference to the circumstance that they were to
      be fellow-guests at Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s house at Hurley-on-Thames, known as The
      Mooring. Phyllis had told him that she was about to pay that visit, and
      when he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I am going as well,&rdquo; she had raised her eyes to his face, an
      unmistakable look of pleasure on her own, as she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad! When do you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On Thursday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go on Tuesday&mdash;two days sooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone in which she spoke made him feel that she had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth shall I do during those dreary two days?&rdquo; or else he had
      become singularly conceited.
    </p>
    <p>
      But even if she had actually said those words they would not have made him
      feel unduly vain. He reflected upon the fact which he had more than once
      previously noticed&mdash;namely, that the girl, though wise as became a
      daughter of a Member of Parliament to be (considering that she had to
      prevent, or do her best to prevent, her father from making a fool of
      himself), was in many respects as innocent and as natural as a girl should
      be. She had only spoken naturally when she had said that she was glad he
      was to be of the riverside party&mdash;when she had implied by her tone
      that she was sorry that two whole days were bound to pass before he should
      arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was there in all that she had said, to make such a man as he vain&mdash;in
      all that she had implied? If she had been six years old instead of
      twenty-three, she would probably have told him that she loved him. The
      innocence of the child would have made her outspoken; but would his vanity
      have been fostered by the confession? It was the charming naturalness of
      the girl that had caused her to speak out what it was but natural she
      should feel. She and he had liked each other from the first, and it was
      quite natural that she should be glad to see him at Hurley.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what he thought as he strolled to his rooms preparatory to
      dressing for some function of the night. He flattered himself that he was
      able to look at any situation straight in the face, so to speak. He
      flattered himself that he was not a man to be led away by vanity. He was,
      as a rule, on very good terms with himself, but he was rather inclined to
      undervalue than overestimate the distinction which he enjoyed among his
      fellow-men. And the result of his due consideration of his last meeting
      with Phyllis was to make him feel that he had never met a girl who was
      quite so nice; but he also felt that, if he were to assume from the
      gladness which she had manifested not merely at being with him that day,
      but at the prospect of meeting him up the river, that he had made an
      impression upon her heart, he would be assuming too much.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all the same, he could not help wishing that Ella had asked him to go
      to The Mooring on Tuesday rather than Thursday; and he felt when Tuesday
      arrived that the hot and dusty town with its ceaseless roll of gloomy
      festivities contained nothing for him that he would not willingly part
      withal in exchange for an hour or two beside the still waters of the
      Thames in the neighborhood of Hurley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stephen Linton had bought The Mooring when his wife had taken a fancy to
      it the previous year, when she had had an attack of that river fever which
      sooner or later takes hold upon Londoners, making them ready to sell all
      their possessions and encamp on the banks of the Thames. It had been a
      great delight to her to furnish that lovely old house according to her
      taste, making each room a picture of consistency in decoration and
      furniture, and it had been a great delight to her to watch the garden
      being laid out after the most perfect eighteenth-century pattern, with its
      green terraces and clipped hedges. She had gone so far as to live in the
      house for close upon a whole fortnight the previous autumn. Since that
      time the caretaker had found it a trifle too cold in the winter and too
      hot in the summer, he had complained to Mrs. Linton. But she knew that
      there is no pleasing caretakers; she had not been put out of favor with
      the place; she hoped to spend at least a week under its roof before the
      end of the season, and perhaps another week before starting for Scotland
      in the autumn.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly came to the conclusion one day that her husband was not
      looking well&mdash;a conclusion which was certainly well founded. She
      declared that a few days up the river was precisely what would restore him
      to robust health. (But here it is to be feared her judgment was in error.)
      He had been thinking too much about the new development of the mine and
      the property surrounding it at Taragonda Creek. What did his receiving a
      couple of hundred thousand pounds matter if his health were jeopardized,
      she inquired of him one day, wearing the anxious face of the Good Wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had smiled that curious smile of his,&mdash;it was becoming more
      curious every day,&mdash;and had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up the river we shall go, and I&rsquo;ll get Phyllis to come with us to amuse
      you&mdash;you know that you like Phyllis,&rdquo; his wife cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no one I like better than Phyllis,&rdquo; he had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the matter had been settled.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during the day or two that followed this settlement, Ella came upon
      several of her friends who she found were looking a trifle fagged through
      the pressure of the season, and she promptly invited them to The Mooring,
      so that she had a party of close upon a dozen persons coming to her house&mdash;some
      for a day, some for as long as three days, commencing with the Tuesday
      when she and Phyllis went off together. Mr. Linton had promised to join
      the party toward the end of the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was how it came about that Herbert Courtland found himself daily
      admiring the cleverness of Phyllis Ayrton when she had the punt pole in
      her hands. He also admired the gradual tinting of her fair face, through
      the becoming exertion of taking the punt up the lovely backwater or on to
      the placid reaches beyond. Sometimes the punt contained three or four of
      the party in addition to Herbert, but twice he was alone with her, and
      shared his admiration of her with no one.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      YOU MAY TRUST MR. COURTLAND.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Linton was greatly amused&mdash;she certainly was surprised. The
      surprises were natural, but the amusement was not quite logical. It was,
      however, quite natural that her guests&mdash;two of them excepted&mdash;should
      be amused when they observed her surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could anything be funnier, one of these guests asked another in a whisper,
      than Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s chagrin on finding that her own particular Sir Lancelot
      had discovered an Elaine for himself?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the guest who was so questioned agreed that nothing could
      possibly be funnier; and they both laughed in unison. If people cannot
      derive innocent fun from watching the disappointment of their hostess, in
      what direction may the elements of mirth be found?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was agreed that Mrs. Linton had invited Herbert Courtland up the river
      for her own special entertainment&mdash;that she had expected him to punt
      her up the river highways and the backwater by-ways, while Phyllis Ayrton
      and the rest of her guests looked after themselves, or looked after Mrs.
      Linton&rsquo;s husband; but it appeared that Herbert Courtland had not been
      consulted on this subject, the result being that Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s
      arrangements had been thrown into confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consensus of opinion among the guests was to the effect that Mrs.
      Linton&rsquo;s arrangements had been thrown very much awry indeed. But then the
      guests were amused, and as it is getting more and more difficult every
      year to amuse one&rsquo;s guests, especially those forming a house-party at a
      season when nothing lends itself to laughter, Mrs. Linton would have had
      every reason to congratulate herself upon the success of her party, had
      she been made aware of the innocent mirth which prevailed for some days
      among her guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would possibly have been greatly diverted also at the overshrewdness
      of her guests, who were, of course, quite ignorant of the conversation
      regarding Phyllis Ayrton which had immediately preceded her invitation to
      Herbert to spend a few days on the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Ella had undoubtedly given Herbert to understand that she was
      anxious to have him at The Mooring while Phyllis was there, in order that
      he might have an opportunity of seeing more of her, and to obtain his
      agreement that her theory that the man who truly loves a woman should be
      ready to marry that woman&rsquo;s dearest friend, still it must be confessed
      that she was surprised to observe the course adopted by both Phyllis and
      Herbert. She had expected that all her tact and diplomacy would be
      required in order to bring the young people&mdash;with all the arrogance
      of the wife of twenty-six years of age she alluded to a girl of
      twenty-three and a man of thirty-two as the young people&mdash;together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had had visions of sitting in the stern of an out-rigger built for
      two, remonstrating with Herbert&mdash;he would of course be at the oars&mdash;for
      choosing to paddle her up the river while he allowed some of the other men
      to carry off Phyllis in, say, the Canadian canoe. A picture had come
      before her of the aggrieved expression upon the face of Herbert when she
      would insist on his going out by the side of Phyllis to feed the peacocks
      on the terraces in the twilight; and she had more than once seemed to hear
      his sigh of resignation as she, with a firmness which she would take pains
      to develop, pleaded a headache so that he and Phyllis might play a game of
      billiards together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon found out that her imagination had not been prophetic.
      Immediately after drinking tea&mdash;it was a few minutes past six&mdash;on
      the evening of the arrival of Herbert, she went out of doors to find him
      and give him a lecture on the need there was for him to refrain from
      waiting about the garden far from the other guests until she, Ella, could
      go on the river with him for a quiet drift before dinner; the other guests
      would certainly think him worse than rude, she was ready to explain. The
      explanation was not needed; she learned that Mr. Courtland had just taken
      Miss Ayrton out in one of the punts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she was pleased&mdash;after an hour by the side of her husband
      to perceive that Herbert had lost no time in making an effort to prove to
      her how amply he recognized her object in asking him to The Mooring. But
      at the same time, if pleased, she was also surprised. At any rate, she
      would take good care that he did not lapse in his attentions to Phyllis;
      as she knew lovers are but too apt to lapse, especially when they begin
      well. She would, for instance, send him from her side in the garden after
      dinner, to walk with Phyllis up to the woods where a nightingale was said
      to be in the habit of singing when the lovely summer twilight had waned
      into the lovely summer night. With the nightingale&rsquo;s song in their ears,
      two ordinary young persons with no preconceived theories on the subject of
      love, have been known, she was well aware, to become lovers of the most
      aggressive type. Yes, she had great hopes of the nightingale.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, apparently, had Herbert Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner there was smoking in the garden, some feeding of the peacocks
      on the terraces, while the blackbirds uttered protests against such an
      absorption by foreign immigrants of the bread that was baked for native
      consumption. Then there was some talk of the nightingale. One man
      suggested that it was a nightingale attached to a music box which the
      enterprise of a local inn had hired for the summer months, sending a man
      to wind it up every night for the attraction of visitors. Then it was that
      Mr. Courtland said he knew a spot where a nightingale had been in the
      habit of singing long ago, when his explorations of the Thames River had
      preceded those of the Fly River. He found three persons who expressed
      their willingness to accept his guidance on the spot, if it were not too
      far away. One of these was Phyllis, the other two were notorious lovers.
      Off they started without hats or caps.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Ella heard when she returned to the garden, whence she had been
      called away for ten minutes to interview a man who had an electric launch
      for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news, communicated to her by her husband in answer to her inquiry, had
      surprised her. That was why she had given a little laugh with a tone of
      derision in it when she had said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nightingale! How lovely! I hope they may find it. It shouldn&rsquo;t prove so
      arduous as the quest of the meteor-bird. I do hope that those children
      will not catch cold. It is a trifle imprudent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imprudent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going off that way with nothing on their heads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or in them. Happy children!&rdquo; cried a moralizing novelist, who was smoking
      an extremely good cigar&mdash;it had not come from his own tobacconist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t all be novel-writers,&rdquo; said one of the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank the Lord!&rdquo; said one of the men, with genuine piety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three-quarters of an hour the members of the quest party returned. They
      had been fully rewarded for their trouble; they had been listening to the
      nightingale for nearly twenty minutes, they said; it had been very lovely,
      they agreed, without a single dissentient voice. It probably was; at any
      rate they were very silent for the rest of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have begun well,&rdquo; said Ella to Herbert, when they found themselves
      together in the drawing room, later on, shortly before midnight. Someone
      was playing on the piano, so that the general conversation and yawning
      were not interfered with. &ldquo;You have begun well. You will soon get to know
      her if your others days here are like to-day. That nightingale! Oh, yes,
      you will soon get to know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; said he, in a low tone. His eyes were turned in the
      direction of Phyllis. She was on a seat at an open window, the twilight of
      moonlight and lamplight glimmering about her hair. &ldquo;I doubt it. It takes a
      man such as I am a long time to know such a girl as Phyllis Ayrton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was a saying which had a certain amount of irritation for Ella. He
      had never said anything in the past about her, Ella, being beyond the
      knowledge of ordinary men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very good beginning,&rdquo; said she, with a little laugh that meant
      much. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t despair. After all, girls are pretty much alike. I was a
      girl once&mdash;it seems a long time ago. I thought then that I knew a
      great deal about men. Alas! all that I have learned since is simply that
      they know a great deal about me. Am I different from other women, I
      wonder? Am I more shallow&mdash;more transparent? Was I ever an enigma to
      you, Bertie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were always a woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is why I am here to-night. If you were not a true woman I should be
      far away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are far away&mdash;from me, Bertie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! I am only beginning to appreciate you&mdash;to understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am to be understood through the medium of Phyllis Ayrton? Isn&rsquo;t that
      like looking at happiness through another&rsquo;s eyes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not appear to catch her meaning at once. He looked at her and then
      his eyes went across the room to Phyllis. At the same instant the
      performance on the piano ceased. Everyone said &ldquo;Thanks, awfully good,&rdquo; and
      there were some audible yawns.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brandy and soda yearning in the men&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get off to bed; someone may begin to play something else,&rdquo;
       whispered the hostess to one of her lady guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men looked as if they had heard the suggestion and heartily approved
      of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening Ella was fortunate enough to get beside Herbert once
      again&mdash;she had scarcely had an opportunity of exchanging a word with
      him all day. He had been with Phyllis alone in the Canadian canoe. It only
      held two comfortably, otherwise&mdash;&mdash;But no one had volunteered to
      put its capacity to the test. Ella had gone in one of the punts with four
      or five of her guests; but the punt never overtook the canoe. It was those
      of the guests who had been in the punt that afterward said it was very
      funny to observe the chagrin of Queen Guinevere when she found that her
      Sir Lancelot had discovered an Elaine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had a delightful day, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Ella. She had found him at
      the bottom of the garden just before dinner. It was not for her he was
      loitering there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Delightful? Perhaps. I shall know more about it ten years hence,&rdquo; he
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are almost gruff as well as unintelligible,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Pray forgive me, Ella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll forgive your gruffness if you make yourself intelligible,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;You frighten me. Ten years hence? What has happened to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothing whatever has happened! and as for ten years hence&mdash;well,
      in ten years hence I shall be looking back to this day either as one of
      the happiest of my life, or as Francesca looked back upon her <i>tempo
      felice</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, now that you get into a foreign language you are quite intelligible.
      You have not spoken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spoken? I? To her&mdash;to her? I have not spoken. I don&rsquo;t believe that I
      shall ever have the courage to speak to her in the sense you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella smiled as she settled a rose on the bodice of her evening dress&mdash;its
      red petals were reposing in that little interspace that dimpled the soft
      shell-pink of her bosom. The man before her had once kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled, as she knew that he was watching her. She wondered if he had
      forgotten that kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should you lose courage at this juncture?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;She hasn&rsquo;t, up
      to the present, shown any very marked antipathy to you, so far as I can
      see. She is certainly not wanting in courage, if you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella,&rdquo; he cried, but in a low voice, &ldquo;Ella, when I look at her, when I
      think of her, I feel inclined to throw my bag into a trap and get back to
      town&mdash;get back to New Guinea with as little delay as possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You would run away?&rdquo; said she, still smiling. She had begun to work with
      the rose in her bosom once more. &ldquo;You would run away? Well, you ran away
      once before, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She could not altogether keep the sneer out of her voice; she could not
      quite deprive her words of their sting. They sounded to her own ears like
      the hiss of a lash in the air. She was amazed at the amount of bitterness
      in her voice&mdash;amazed and ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood before her, silently looking at her. There was no reproach in his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Bertie, Bertie, forgive me!&rdquo; she said, laying her hand on his arm.
      &ldquo;Forgive me; I don&rsquo;t know what I am saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was some piteousness in her voice and eyes. She was appealing to him
      for pity, but he did not know it. Every man thinks that the world was made
      for himself alone, and he goes tramping about it, quite careless as to
      where he plants his heavy feet. When occasionally he gets a thorn in one
      of his feet, he feels quite aggrieved. He never stops to think of all the
      things his foot crushes quite casually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Herbert Courtland had no capacity for knowing how the woman before him was
      suffering. He should have known, from the words he had just heard her
      speak. He should have known that they had been wrung from her. He did not
      know, however; he was not thinking of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertie,&rdquo; she said again, &ldquo;Bertie, you are not angry? I did not know what
      I was saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a woman,&rdquo; he said gently, and it was just by reason of this
      gentleness that there seemed to be a reproach in his voice. He reproached
      her for being a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am a woman&mdash;just as other women, just as other women.&rdquo; Her voice
      sounded like a moan. &ldquo;I thought myself different, stronger&mdash;perhaps
      worse than other women. I was wrong. Oh, Bertie! cannot you see that she
      loves you as I loved you long ago&mdash;oh, so long ago? And someone has
      said that there is no past tense in love! No, no! she does not love you as
      I loved you&mdash;guiltily; no, her love is the love that purifies, that
      exalts. She loves you, and she waits for you to tell her that you love
      her. You love her, Bertie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause before he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And it was at this point that Phyllis came up. Was there no expression of
      suspicion on her face as she looked at them standing together?
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was, they failed to notice it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came out to get a rose,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;How quickly you dressed, Ella! Ah,
      you have got your rose&mdash;a beauty! Your gardener is generous; he
      actually allows you to pluck your own roses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Courtland will choose one for you,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;You may trust Mr.
      Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To choose me a rose? Well, on that recommendation, Mr. Courtland, I think
      I may safely place myself in your hands. I will accept a rose of your
      choosing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she did.

      CHAPTER XXXII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      LET THEM BOTH GO TOGETHER TO PERDITION.
    </h3>
    <p>
      There could be no doubt whatever that, after all, he had not proposed to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was what Herbert Courtland&rsquo;s fellow-guests said when they learned
      that he had left for London by an early train on Monday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the way she had thrown herself at his head, too!
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course she pretended not to feel his departure any more than the rest
      of the party; and equally as a matter of course, Mrs. Linton protested
      that Mr. Courtland had disappointed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And perhaps he had, too, some of the guests whispered to one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Linton shrugged his shoulders and remarked that business was business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone agreed with the general accuracy of this assertion, but it was
      not one that required much boldness to make, and what it had to do with
      Mr. Courtland&rsquo;s hurried departure no one seemed quite able to perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general idea that had prevailed at The Mooring on the subject of Mr.
      Courtland was that he would remain at the house after all the other guests&mdash;Miss
      Ayrton only excepted&mdash;had left.
    </p>
    <p>
      During Monday several were to return to town, and the remainder on
      Tuesday, including Miss Ayrton. She required to do so to be in time for a
      grand function at which Royalty was to be present on that night. Mrs.
      Linton herself meant to return on Wednesday afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late on Sunday night when Herbert had gone to Ella&rsquo;s side and told
      her that he found it necessary to leave for town early in the morning
      instead of waiting until Tuesday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Heavens!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;what is the meaning of this? What will people
      say? You do not mean to tell me that she&mdash;she&mdash;&mdash;Oh, no;
      that would be impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is impossible,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Nothing&mdash;not even my running
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have told her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told her nothing. I am not sure that I have anything to tell her.
      I am going away to make sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well. But I must say that I think you are wrong&mdash;quite
      wrong. There is that Mr. Holland; he is coming into greater prominence
      than ever since that article of his appeared in the <i>Zeit Geist</i>.
      Stephen says he will certainly have to leave the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Mr. Holland got to say to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More than meets the eye. You must remember that three months ago she was
      engaged to marry him. Now, though I don&rsquo;t mean to say that she ever truly
      loved him, yet there is no smoke without fire; it is very often that two
      persons who have become engaged to be married love each other. Now, if
      Phyllis ever had a tender feeling for Mr. Holland, and only threw him over
      because his theories are not those of Philistia, in the midst of which she
      had always lived, that feeling is certain to become tenderer if he is
      about to be made a martyr of. Would you like to see her thrown away upon
      George Holland?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Herbert looked at the woman who could thus plead the cause&mdash;if that
      was not too strong a phrase&mdash;of the girl whom he had come to love. He
      felt that he was only beginning to know something about woman and her
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must go. I am not sure of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had best make sure of her, and then you will become sure of
      yourself,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be to do her an injustice. No. I feel that I must go,&rdquo; he
      cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      And go he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those of the guests who remained during Monday did their best to find out
      how Phyllis was disposed to regard his departure; and there was a
      consensus of opinion among them that she seemed greatly mortified, though
      she made a splendid fight, trying to appear utterly indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, however, no ignoring the circumstance that Ella was elated at
      his departure; some of her guests even went so far as to suggest that she
      had accelerated his departure, giving him to understand that, however a
      young woman might throw herself at his head,&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t Phyllis just
      throw herself at his head?&mdash;he had no right to give her all his
      attention; a hostess has a right to claim some of his spare moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until Tuesday, when Mr. Linton had left for London, and Phyllis
      was alone with Ella for an hour before lunch, that the latter endeavored
      to find out what she thought of Herbert Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has Stephen been speaking to you about George Holland?&rdquo; she inquired. She
      thought that the best way to lead Phyllis to talk about Herbert would be
      by beginning to talk about George Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;He appears to be greatly interested in Mr.
      Holland. He thinks that he must leave the Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be very sad,&rdquo; remarked Ella. &ldquo;It would seem very like
      persecution, would it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot see that there would be any injustice in the matter,&rdquo; said
      Phyllis. &ldquo;If a man chooses to write such things as he has written, he must
      take the consequences. I, for my part, intend keeping away from the church
      as long as Mr. Holland remains in the pulpit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not think it necessary to refer to the remarks made by Mr. Holland
      upon the occasion of his last visit to her, though these words might not
      be without interest to Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it seems hard, doesn&rsquo;t it, to deprive a man of his profession simply
      because he holds certain views on what is, after all, an abstract subject&mdash;the
      patriarchs, or the prophets and things of that sort?&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady Earlscourt said that he should be forgiven, because he really didn&rsquo;t
      hold the views which he had preached,&rdquo; laughed Phyllis. &ldquo;She also said
      that he should not be regarded as an atheist, because he believed not only
      in one God, but in two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder how many Herbert Courtland believes in,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;You told me
      he talked to you on that topic the first night you met. Was it about God
      you and he have been talking lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! you found a more interesting topic, and one of more importance to two
      people in the bloom of youth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, I don&rsquo;t mean anything dreadful. Only, you know as well as I
      do that a healthy man and a healthy woman will never talk, when they are
      alone together, about God, when they can talk about each other. I think
      Herbert Courtland is about the healthiest man I know, and I&rsquo;m sure that
      you are the healthiest girl. You and he are most sympathetic companions.
      You are not at all stupidly coy, my sweet maiden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like Mr. Courtland, and why should I be coy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed? I wonder what the people who have just left us will say
      about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About it? About what!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You coyness&mdash;or absence of coyness. Will they say that you threw
      yourself at his head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      (As a matter of fact, as is already known, that is just what the majority
      of the guests did say about her.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis reddened and seemed&mdash;for a moment or two&mdash;almost angry.
      Then she made a little gesture, expressive of indifference, as she cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, what does it matter what they said? I don&rsquo;t care about them.
      It is for you I care, Ella&mdash;you, only you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! how seriously you say that!&rdquo; cried Ella. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no cause for
      seriousness, I hope, even if you do care a great deal for me, which I know
      you do. If you said so much to a man,&mdash;say, Herbert Courtland,&mdash;it
      would be quite another matter. There would be sufficient cause for
      seriousness then. But you didn&rsquo;t say so much to him. He ran away before
      you could say it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ella! please don&rsquo;t talk in that way. It is not like yourself to talk
      in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know what is like myself and what is not? You have only seen
      one side of me, and I don&rsquo;t think that you have understood even what you
      have seen. Great Heavens! how could I expect that you should. Not until
      within a few months ago had I myself any idea that my nature was made up
      of more than one element. Do you fancy now that you will always be in the
      future as you have been in the past? The same placid, sweet English girl,
      with serious thoughts at times about your own soul and other people&rsquo;s
      souls? a maiden living with her feet only touching the common clay of this
      earth? Wait until your hour comes&mdash;your hour of love; your hour of
      fate; your hour of self-abandonment, and pray to your God that you may
      come through it as well as I came through mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella, dearest Ella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know nothing of that hour&mdash;that terrible hour! Wait until it
      comes to you before you think a word of evil against any woman that lives
      in the world. Wait until your hour of jealousy comes&mdash;wait until you
      find that your hair is turning gray. The most tragical moment in a woman&rsquo;s
      life is when she finds that the gray hairs will not be kept back. That is
      the time when she thinks of Heaven most seriously. I have not yet found a
      single gray hair in my head, but I have suffered all else; and I have been
      an astonishment to myself&mdash;as I have been to you more than once
      before now, and as I certainly am to you at the present moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken at first with quivering lips, her fingers interlaced, her
      eyes flashing. She had sprung from her seat and had begun to pace the room
      just as she had paced Phyllis&rsquo; drawing room on that night when she had
      missed the performance of &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet,&rdquo; but she ended with a laugh,
      which was meant to make a mock of the seriousness of her impassioned
      words, but which only had the effect of emphasizing her passion in the
      ears of the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was still lying back, laughing, in the chair into which she had
      thrown herself once more, Phyllis went to her and knelt at her feet,
      taking her hands just as Herbert had taken her hands in the evening when
      he had knelt at her feet in her own house after the little dinner at Mr.
      Ayrton&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella, Ella,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;I also am a woman. Oh, my dearest! I think
      that I can understand something of your heart. I know a little. Oh, Ella,
      Ella! I would do anything in the world to help you&mdash;anything&mdash;anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you?&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;Would you do anything? Would you give up
      Herbert Courtland in order to help me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had grasped Phyllis by the wrists and had bent her own head forward
      until her face was within an inch of Phyllis&rsquo;. Their breaths mingled.
      Their faces were too close to admit of either of them seeing the
      expression that was in the eyes of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Ella, you will not break my heart!&rdquo; said the girl piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you give him up for your love of me?&rdquo; the woman cried again, and
      Phyllis felt her hands tighten upon her wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will forget that you have said such words,&rdquo; said the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman flung away her hands after retaining them for a few moments in
      silence, and then throwing herself back in her chair, laughed loud and
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis rose to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You poor dear!&rdquo; cried Ella. &ldquo;It was a shame&mdash;a shame to play such a
      jest upon you! But I felt in a tragic mood, and the line between comedy
      and tragedy is a very fine one. Forgive my little freak, dear; and let us
      be human beings once more, living in a world that cannot be taken so
      seriously. Don&rsquo;t go by the evening train, Phyllis; stay all night with me.
      I have so much to say to you. I want to talk to you. How can you leave me
      here all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis could have told her that how she could leave her all alone was
      because Herbert Courtland had left for London on the previous day. She did
      not make an explanation to her on this basis, however; she merely said
      that it would interfere with her plans to remain longer at The Moorings.
      She had to attend that great function with her father that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella called her very unkind, but showed no desire to revert to the topic
      upon which they had been conversing, when she had thought fit to ask her
      that jocular question which Phyllis had said she would forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Phyllis did not keep her word. On the contrary she thought of nothing
      else but that question all the time she was in the railway carriage going
      to Paddington.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a terrible question in Phyllis&rsquo; eyes for a woman with a husband to
      put to her girl-friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than once during the week Phyllis had been led to ask herself if she
      was quite certain that her terrible surmise regarding the influence which
      dominated Ella&rsquo;s recent actions was true. Now and again she felt an
      impulse to fall upon her knees and pray, as she had once before prayed,
      that the sin of that horrible suspicion might be forgiven her. How could
      it be possible, she thought, that Ella should forget all that a true woman
      should ever remember!
    </p>
    <p>
      But now&mdash;now, as she sat in the train on her way back to London,
      there was no room left in her mind for doubt on this matter. The tragic
      earnestness with which Ella had asked her that question, tightening her
      fingers upon her wrists? &ldquo;<i>Will you give up Herbert Courtland in order
      to help me?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the passionate whisper, the quivering lips&mdash;all
      told her with overwhelming force that what she had surmised was the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt that Ella had confessed to her that her infatuation&mdash;Phyllis
      called it infatuation&mdash;had not passed away, though she had been
      strong enough upon that night, when her husband had so suddenly returned,
      to fly from its consequences. No, her infatuation had not died.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Herbert Courtland&mdash;what of him? He had also had strength&mdash;once.
      Would he have strength again? He had told her, while they were together in
      one of the boats drifting down the placid river, that he believed in the
      influence which a woman could exercise upon a man&rsquo;s life being capable of
      changing his nature so completely as if a miracle had been formed upon
      him. She had not had the courage to ask him if he had any particular
      instance in his mind that impressed this belief upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been led to cast that infatuation&mdash;if he had ever been
      subjected to it&mdash;behind him, by reason of her influence over him
      since she had repeated to him the pathetic words of Mrs. Haddon, and he
      had gone straight aboard the yacht on that strange cruise?
    </p>
    <p>
      She could scarcely doubt that he was ready to acknowledge how great had
      been her influence upon his life. He had shown her in countless ways that
      she had accomplished all that she had sought to achieve. She had had no
      need to throw herself at his head&mdash;the phrase which Ella suggested
      her fellow-guests would probably employ in referring to the relative
      positions of Phyllis and Herbert. No, she had ever found him by her side,
      and it did not need her to exercise much cleverness to keep him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then, why had he so suddenly hurried away from that pleasant life
      beside the still waters?
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the question which was on her mind as the train ran into the
      station at Paddington. She got out of the carriage, and while her maid
      went to look after the luggage, she glanced down the platform for the
      footman. He came up to her in a moment and took her dressing-bag and
      jewel-case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The brougham is here, I suppose?&rdquo; she said, as she walked down the
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the entrance to the station, he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused for a moment, and glanced back to see if there had been much
      luggage in the train which she had left&mdash;if her maid would be likely
      to be kept waiting for long. At that instant a porter, with a portmanteau
      on his shoulder and a Gladstone bag in his hand, hurrying up by the side
      of the train which was ready to depart from the next platform, shouted to
      a group of Eton boys who were blocking the way:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By your leave, gents!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started and took a step to one side, and that instant was sufficient
      to make her aware of the fact that the portmanteau carried by the porter
      to the train which was about to leave for Maidenhead was Herbert
      Courtland&rsquo;s. There was no mistaking it. It bore on one end his initials
      and his private sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took a few steps nearer the train by which she had come, and followed
      the porter with her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the portmanteau into the luggage van, and then returned with the
      Gladstone bag to the side of a compartment. She saw him place it in the
      network, and touch his cap as he received his <i>douceur</i> from the
      passenger who sat at the door with an evening paper in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that that passenger was Herbert Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      She told the footman who stood beside her to take her bag and case to the
      brougham and then return to help her maid with the rest of the luggage. He
      followed her down the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time she was being driven home, her maid following with the
      luggage in another vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not begin to change her traveling dress immediately on retiring to
      her room. She did not even take off her hat. She stood at the window
      looking out over a scene very different from that which had been before
      her eyes every day during the previous week. After a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s
      listlessness at the window, she spent another quarter of an hour sitting
      motionless in a chair. Then she rose and looked at herself in a mirror
      that showed her herself from head to foot. She examined her feet with
      curious deliberation, and then looked with a critical side glance at the
      reflection of her face. (She could not fail to have noticed that it was
      unusually pale.) She removed her hat, surveyed herself once more, then,
      turning away with an exclamation of impatience, she crumpled up her hat
      with both her hands and flung it, just as a wicked child would have flung
      it, across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them both go together to perdition&mdash;to perdition&mdash;to
      perdition!&rdquo; she said with a bitterness that had never previously been in
      her voice. &ldquo;Let them go together. I have done my best for them&mdash;for
      her&mdash;for her. I give them up now for evermore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After a minute or two of statuesque passion she went across the room and
      picked up her bruised hat. She looked at it, turning it round in her
      hands. Then she dropped it suddenly, and flung herself upon the sofa,
      crying out in a whirlwind of tears:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ella, Ella, I would have saved you&mdash;I meant to save you, indeed!
      I would have done everything to save you&mdash;everything!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I WONDER IF I EVER LOVED YOU UNTIL THIS MOMENT.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was a rather tedious evening for Ella Linton after Phyllis had taken
      her departure. Why on earth, she asked herself, had she been such a fool
      as to lay out her plans to have this lonely evening? Then she remembered
      that two of her guests had meant to stay until Wednesday morning, but had
      received a letter necessitating their departure for town on Monday night.
      But this fact should not have condemned her to a solitary evening, Ella
      reflected. She should have been thoughtful enough to change her own plans
      to correspond with the change in the plans of her guests. A nice, quiet,
      contemplative evening beside the still waters may suit the requirements of
      some temperaments, but it was not just what Ella regarded as most
      satisfying to her mood of the hour. It was a long time since she had spent
      a lonely evening, and although she had now rather more food for
      contemplation than at any other period of her life, she did not feel
      contemplative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it suddenly occurred to her to ask herself why, after all, should she
      be condemned to a contemplative evening? What was there to hinder her
      taking a train to town after she had dined? Once in town she knew that all
      prospect of contemplation would be at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rang her bell and told her maid that she had changed her mind in
      regard to staying another night at The Mooring; she would leave after
      dinner; wasn&rsquo;t there a train about nine from Maidenhead?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was when she was about to go down to dinner that she heard the sound of
      wheels upon the gravel walk. Was it possible that her newly made plans
      might also be deranged? Was this a fresh visitor arriving by a fly from
      Maidenhead&mdash;she saw that the vehicle was a fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one in the room to hear the cry of delight that she gave when
      she saw Herbert at the porch of the house, the driver having deposited his
      portmanteau and Gladstone bag at his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had returned to her&mdash;he, whom she fancied to be far away; he who
      had forsaken her, as she thought, as she feared, as she (at times) hoped,
      forever. He had returned to her. There was no one now to stand between
      them. He was all her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung off the dress which she was wearing,&mdash;it was her plainest
      evening gown,&mdash;and had actually got on another, a lovely one that she
      had never yet worn, before her maid arrived at her dressing room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Louise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;send a message downstairs to show Mr. Courtland to
      his room, and mention that he will dine with me. Come back at once. I have
      got so far in my dressing without you; I can&rsquo;t go much further, however.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a quarter of an hour she was surveying herself in her mirror just as
      Phyllis had been doing an hour sooner; only on her face was a very
      different expression from that which Phyllis had worn. Her eyes were
      brilliant as they never had been before, except once; her face was not
      pale, but full of soft color, as if she were standing beneath the shadow
      of a mighty rose-leaf with the sunlight above. Her neck and arms were of
      the same delicate tinge. Her smile she gave as she surveyed herself was a
      smile of triumph, very different from the expression on poor Phyllis&rsquo; 
      features as she flung her hat across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine, mine, mine!&rdquo; she whispered, nodding with a smile at the lovely
      thing so full of warm life that faced her with a smile. &ldquo;He is mine&mdash;he
      has come back to me, I will keep him. I shall be able to keep him, I
      think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had scarcely entered the drawing room before he was beside her, and he
      had scarcely entered before a servant announced that dinner was served.
      They were seated at the dinner table before they had exchanged half a
      dozen words&mdash;before she had time to ask him why he had returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at the table, with a servant at each end, what could they say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, she gave in detail, with the accuracy of a railway time-table, the
      hours of the departure of the various guests, down to the last departed
      guest, who chanced to be Miss Ayrton. Yes, she was obliged to go up to
      town to be present at that important function which was to be given in the
      presence of Royalty, though, she, Mrs. Linton, was convinced that Phyllis
      would much prefer remaining in the midst of that exquisite quietude which
      seemed to be found only up the river. She had wanted her dear Phyllis to
      stay until the morrow, but poor Phyllis&rsquo; sense of duty had been, as
      unfortunately it always was, too great for her inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unfortunately?&rdquo; said Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I say unfortunately?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How funny! I meant of course,
      unfortunately for her friends&mdash;for myself in this particular case.
      But, after all, we had a delightful week together. It has done us all good&mdash;even
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why the &lsquo;even&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, because you are not expected to feel the fatigues of a London
      season. And then you must remember that you had a yachting cruise which
      must have done you a world of good,&rdquo; she added, with a smile born of the
      mood which was on her&mdash;a mood of joy and laughter and daring. She
      felt that she could say anything she pleased to say to him now; she could
      have referred with a laugh to his running away on that strange cruise of
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it did me a great deal of good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke slowly, and her quick ear detected a tone of gravity in his
      voice. What could he mean? Oh, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that that last phase of the mine will soon be settled,&rdquo; said she.
      &ldquo;It was that which curtailed your cruise, you will remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly do remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the business will soon be settled one way or another. I don&rsquo;t
      think this running to Paris so frequently is good for Stephen. Haven&rsquo;t you
      noticed how poorly he has been looking of late?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t seem to me to be particularly robust. But I think that he
      pulled himself together while he was here. Oh, yes! another week will see
      us free from this business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And with an extra million or so in your pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, something in that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was how they talked while the servants were present&mdash;about
      business and money and matters that may be discussed in the presence of
      servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went together into the drawing room. It was not yet dark enough
      for the candles to be lighted. The exquisite summer twilight was hanging
      over the river and the banks opposite, wooded from the water&rsquo;s edge to the
      summit. It was the hour of delicate blue touched with pink about the
      borders. The hour of purple and silver stars had not yet come.
    </p>
    <p>
      She threw open one of the windows on its hinges, and in a moment the room
      was flooded with the perfume of the roses of the garden. She stood in the
      opening of the window and seemed to drink in the garden scents before they
      floated into the room. Then from some secret nestling place in the dark
      depths of the clipped hedge there came the even-song of a blackbird. It
      was replied to from the distance; and the silence that followed only
      seemed to be silence. It was a silence made vocal by the bending of a
      thousand notes&mdash;all musical. The blackbirds, the thrushes, the robins
      made up a chorus of harmony as soothing to the soul as silence. Then came
      the cooings of the wood pigeons. The occasional shriek of a peacock was
      the only note out of harmony with the feeling breathed by the twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood at the open window, her back turned to him, for some time. He
      felt slightly embarrassed. Her attitude somehow suggested to him an
      imprisonment; he was captured; she was standing between him and the open
      air; she was barring his passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she turned. With her movement there seemed to float into the room
      a great breath of rose-scent. It was only that the light showed him more
      clearly at that moment the glowing whiteness of her neck and shoulders and
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you come back?&rdquo; she cried, almost piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you know why, Ella,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing: a man is one thing one day and quite the opposite the
      next day. How can I know anything of what is in your mind to-day&mdash;in
      your heart to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came back thinking to find her here still&mdash;I fancied that you said
      she would stay until you were returning to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You came back for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came back to see her&mdash;I find that I cannot live without seeing
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have only found that out since you left here yesterday morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only since I left here. I told you that I was not sure of myself. That is
      why I went away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went away to make sure of yourself, and now you return to make sure
      of her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if I could but think that! If I could only be as sure of her as I am
      of myself. But what am I that I should dare to hope? Oh, she is above all
      womankind&mdash;a crown of girlhood! What am I that I should ask to wear
      this crown of girlhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a king of men, Bertie. Only for the king of men is such a crown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed as she stood looking at him as she leaned against the half
      open door of the window, one hand being on the framework above her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella, you know her!&rdquo; he cried, facing her. She began to swing gently to
      the extent of an inch or two, still leaning on the edge of the hinged
      window. She was looking at him through half-closed, curious eyes. &ldquo;Ella,
      you know her&mdash;she has always been your friend; tell me if I should
      speak to her or if I should go back to the work that I have begun in New
      Guinea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you be guided by me, Bertie?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly ceasing her
      movement with the window and going very close to him indeed&mdash;so close
      that he could feel the gracious warmth of her face and bare neck and
      shoulders. &ldquo;Would you be guided by me, I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have I not been guided by you up to the present, Ella?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Should
      I be here to-night if it were not for your goodness? I laughed some time
      ago&mdash;how long ago it seems!&mdash;when you told me&mdash;you said it
      was your dearest wish&mdash;I did not then believe it possible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you fancy that I believed it possible?&rdquo; she asked, with some
      sadness in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Heavens! Ella, do you mean to tell me that you&mdash;&mdash;Oh, no,
      it is impossible! You knew me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancied that I knew you, Bertie. I fancied that I knew myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella, Ella, for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t let us drift again. Have you no
      recollection of that terrible time through which we both passed&mdash;that
      ordeal by fire. Ella, we were plucked from the fire&mdash;she plucked us
      from the very fire of hell itself&mdash;oh, don&rsquo;t let us drift in that
      direction again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had walked away from her. He was beginning to recall too vividly the
      old days, under the influence of her gracious presence so close to him&mdash;not
      so close as it had been, but still close enough to bring back old
      memories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here and stand beside me, Bertie,&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation he went to her, slowly, not with the rapture
      of a lover&mdash;not with the old passion trembling in his hands, on his
      lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put her hands behind her and looked at him in the face for a long
      time. The even-songs of the birds mixed with the scent of the roses; the
      blue shadow of the twilight was darkening over the trees at the foot of
      her garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the oleanders?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I never breathe in such a
      twilight as this without seeing before me the oleanders outlined against
      its blue. It was very sweet at that old place on the Arno.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella, Ella&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You told me that terrible secret of your life&mdash;that you loved me. I
      wonder if I knew what it meant, Bertie? I told you that I loved you: that
      was more terrible still. I wonder if you knew what that meant, Bertie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bird&rsquo;s songs outside were becoming softer and more intermittent.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a sudden cry as if stung with pain, and started away from the
      window. She threw herself down on the couch, burying her face in the
      pillows&mdash;he could see through the dim room the whiteness of her arms.
      She was breathing convulsively; but she was not sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained beside the open window. He, too, was not breathing so
      regularly as he had breathed a short time before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the sigh that came from her as she raised her head from the
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you ever really loved me, Bertie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if you ever loved me; and I wonder if I ever loved you until
      this moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence. Outside there was a little whisper of moving wings,
      but no voice of bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, and out of it a low voice cried softly, softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bertie, Bertie, my love, come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took a step toward her, a second step&mdash;and then he stood, rigid,
      breathless, for he heard another soft voice that said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>His honor is the honor of his mother and his sister, upon which no
      stain must come.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He heard that voice, and with a cry he covered his face with his hands,
      and turning, fled through the open window into the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lay there on her couch, that lovely white creature who had been saved
      so as by fire. There are two fires: the one is the fire that consumes the
      heart until all that is left of it is the dust of ashes; the other is the
      fire that purifies the soul even unto its salvation; and yet both fires
      burn alike, so that men and women know not which is burning within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did she know that she was saved so as by fire?
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed as though he could still hear her; but after her laugh there
      came a few moments of overwhelming bitterness that sent her on her knees
      by the side of the couch in self-abasement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill me&mdash;kill me, O God!&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;Kill me, for I am not fit to
      live!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she was spared.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time she found strength to rise. She seemed surprised to find that
      the room was in darkness. She struck a light, and in a few minutes a dozen
      candles were flaring round the walls; and then she went mechanically to
      close the window. One side she had just fastened when it seemed to her
      that she heard the sound of voices approaching. She listened, her head
      bent forward through the side of the window that remained unclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, their voices were sounding clearly through the still night&mdash;his
      voice and&mdash;what trick was being played upon her by her hearing?
      Phyllis&rsquo; voice? How could it be Phyllis&rsquo; voice? Phyllis had returned to
      London. Oh, it was some trick! Her nerves were playing some trick upon her&mdash;they
      were out of order, they were beyond her control. Phyllis&rsquo; voice&mdash;&mdash;Great
      Heavens! it was Phyllis herself who was walking through the garden by his
      side!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella stood at the open side of the window staring out at them. They stood
      at the foot of the half dozen steps that lead up to the window. Phyllis
      laughed,&mdash;was there a trace of mockery in her laugh?&mdash;but he was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at your fancying that I am a ghost, Ella,&rdquo; cried the girl.
      &ldquo;I feel that I deserve to be treated as discourteously as most poor ghosts
      are treated when they visit their friends. You never yet heard of a ghost
      being asked to stay to dinner, did you, Mr. Courtland? But a ghost may
      fairly claim to be asked to enter the house of her dearest friend,
      especially after a double railway journey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella had not moved from her place at the open space of the window while
      Phyllis was speaking, but the moment that the girl&rsquo;s laugh sounded, she
      too laughed. She ran down the steps and put her arms about Phyllis,
      kissing her on the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is more than the most exacting of ghosts could reasonable look for,&rdquo;
       cried Phyllis. &ldquo;Oh, Ella! I&rsquo;m so glad that I followed my own impulse and
      came back to you. I thought you were here all alone&mdash;how could I know
      that Mr. Courtland would return in the meantime to complete his visit?&mdash;and
      when I looked out on the dust and the smoke of the town and thought of
      this&mdash;this&mdash;this exquisite stillness,&mdash;you can just hear
      the water of the weir,&mdash;this garden, this scent of roses, but chiefly
      when I thought of you sitting in your loneliness&mdash;&mdash;Well, is it
      any wonder that I am here now?&mdash;you implored of me to stay, you know,
      Ella.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is no wonder indeed, being what you are&mdash;a good angel, my good
      angel, Phyllis,&rdquo; cried the woman. &ldquo;Oh, dearest, you are welcome! Why did
      you leave me Phyllis? Why did you leave me? Oh, the good angels can never
      be trusted. You should not have left me to myself, dear. I am only a
      woman. Ah, you don&rsquo;t yet know what a woman is. That is the worst of angels
      and men; they don&rsquo;t know what a woman is. Come into the house, Phyllis.
      Come in, Herbert. How did you manage to meet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I went out to the garden&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I knew that&mdash;you left me alone,&rdquo; said the woman, and she gave a
      laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I strolled from the garden to the road&mdash;I had to ask the people at
      the Old Bell to keep a room for me, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just outside the inn I came face to face with Miss Ayrton&rsquo;s fly. Miss
      Ayrton was good enough to get out and walk with me, sending the fly on
      with her maid. I told the man to wait in order to take my portmanteau to
      the inn. It must be at the hall door now. We entered by the garden gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing could be simpler,&rdquo; said Ella. They had by this time walked up the
      steps into the drawing room. &ldquo;Nothing could be simpler.&rdquo; Then she turned
      to Phyllis. &ldquo;But how did you contrive to evade the great function
      to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Papa did not feel very well,&rdquo; said Phyllis, &ldquo;and I know that he was only
      too glad of an excuse to stay at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you forsook your sick father to come to me? Oh, my dear Phyllis, what
      have you done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you ask me in confidence I should say that papa is not quite so ill as
      to stand in need of a nurse,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Oh, no! Make your mind easy.
      I have neglected no duty in coming to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Except your duty to yourself; you could not have had time to take any
      dinner at home. I shall have you a servants&rsquo; hall supper in ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please get nothing for me. I had a capital sort of dinner at home. But I
      should dearly like a cup of tea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be ready for you the moment you return from taking off your hat.
      I&rsquo;ll go up with you to your room; Mr. Courtland knows that even I make
      myself at home in this house. He will pardon us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t keep the fly waiting for my portmanteau,&rdquo; said Mr. Courtland.
      &ldquo;If you will allow me, I shall look to it now, and say good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t think of running off in this way,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;What
      reason had you for returning at all if you run off at this hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is getting quite late. I mustn&rsquo;t keep the good people of the Old Bell
      up on my account,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Besides, a man represents a certain
      inharmonious element upon such an occasion as this. Miss Ayrton returned
      expecting to be with you alone. I know the disabilities of a man quite
      well. Yes, I must say good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! Pray talk to him, Phyllis,&rdquo; cried Ella. &ldquo;You may make him
      amenable to reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Phyllis stood mute with her hand on the handle of the door; she only
      smiled, and there is neither reason nor argument in a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, if you really have nothing to say to either of us,&mdash;to
      either Phyllis or me,&mdash;you had better go, I suppose,&rdquo; said Ella,
      giving him her hand, but she did not look at him in the face while his
      hand was touching hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough, neither did Phyllis look at him as was her wont.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he left them that night.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GIVE HIM BACK TO ME&mdash;GIVE HIM BACK TO ME!
    </h3>
    <p>
      They seemed to have been parted for months instead of hours, so much had
      they to say to each other, and so rapidly did they say it. Rapidly?&mdash;feverishly
      rather. Phyllis had only to remove her hat and smooth her hair at places,
      disordering it at others, in order to be all right; but half an hour had
      gone by before they went downstairs, arm in arm, after the manner of girls
      who have been talking feverishly and kissing every now and again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was madness for Phyllis to think of tea at that hour of the night, Ella
      declared; but she knew Phyllis&rsquo; fancies in the past&mdash;she knew that
      what would set other girls&rsquo; nerves in motion, would only have the effect
      of soothing hers. So Phyllis drank her tea and ate her cake in the drawing
      room, and Ella lay back on the sofa and watched her with a curious
      interest in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad that we are spending together in this way the last night of
      our delightful week,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;What a lovely week it has been! and
      the charm of it is, of course, to be found in the fact that it has been
      stolen from the best part of the season. In another month it would not be
      nearly so delightful&mdash;everyone will be hurrying off to the river or
      elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a week is one of the incidents that a person plans but that rarely
      comes off according to one&rsquo;s views,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;I told you when I set my
      heart upon Hurley what my idea was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have certainly realized it during this week. What a pity it is
      that this is our last night together!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, Phyllis, the way you said that suggested to me that you
      meant &lsquo;What a pity it is that Herbert Courtland is not one of our party
      to-night&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ella was still lying on the broad pillows of the couch, her hands clasped
      at the back of her head. She was still watching Phyllis through her
      half-closed eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was not thinking about Mr. Courtland in the least when I spoke. How can
      you fancy that I should be so insincere? I say it is delightful for us,
      you and me only, mind, to be together to-night, because we can say just
      whatever occurs to us&mdash;I thought we could, you know; but since you
      made that horrid suggestion I think I must take back all that I said. It
      is, after all, not nearly so nice to be alone with you as one would
      imagine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was, I&rsquo;m afraid, the conclusion that Herbert Courtland came to some
      time ago,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;He was alone with me here&mdash;yes, for some
      minutes; but he left me&mdash;he left me and found you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was so funny!&rdquo; cried Phyllis. &ldquo;Who would have thought of seeing such a
      figure&mdash;bareheaded and in evening dress&mdash;on the road? I knew him
      at once, however. And he was walking so quickly too&mdash;walking as if&mdash;as
      if&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if the devil were behind him&mdash;that&rsquo;s how men put it,&rdquo; said Ella.
      &ldquo;It would never do for us to say that, of course, but in this particular
      case we might venture on it for the sake of strict accuracy; the devil was
      behind him. He escaped from it by the aid of his good angel. Didn&rsquo;t he
      call you his good angel once, my Phyllis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he called me so once,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;But why should we talk about
      Mr. Courtland? Why should we talk about anybody to-night? Dearest Ella,
      let us talk about ourselves. You are of more interest to me than anyone in
      the world, and I know that I am of more interest to you than to anyone
      else. Let us talk about ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly we shall talk about ourselves,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;To begin, I should
      like very much to know if you were aware that Herbert had returned to this
      house after his day or two in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis undoubtedly colored before she said, with a laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you promise to talk solely about ourselves? I decline to talk on
      any other topic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She arose from where she had been sitting before a cup of tea at a little
      table that also held cake, and threw herself back in a fanciful seat
      shaped like a shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That being so, I should like very much to know how you learned that he
      meant to return,&rdquo; pursued Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are becoming quite horrid, and I expected you to be so nice,&rdquo; said
      Phyllis, pouting very prettily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I expected you to confide in me,&rdquo; said Ella reproachfully. &ldquo;I have
      been watching you for some time&mdash;not merely during the past week, but
      long before; and I have seen&mdash;what I have seen. He could not have
      told you that he meant to return&mdash;you must have crossed each other in
      the trains. How did you know, my dear girl? Let me coax it out of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis made no answer for some time; she was examining, with a newly
      acquired, but very intense interest, the texture of the sheen of the
      blouse which she was wearing. At last she raised her eyes, and saw how
      Ella was looking at her. Then she said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw him in the train that was leaving when our train arrived.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! that is a confession!&rdquo; cried Ella quite merrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forced it from me,&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;But why should there be any
      mystery between us? I&rsquo;m sure I may tell you all the secrets of my life.
      Such as they are, you know them already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are safe in my keeping. My dear Phyllis, don&rsquo;t you know that it has
      always been my dearest hope to see you and Herbert Courtland&mdash;well,
      interested in each other? I saw that he was interested in you long ago;
      but I wasn&rsquo;t sure of you. That is just why I was so anxious for you to
      come down here for the week we have just passed. I wanted to bring you
      both together. I wanted to see you in love with each other; I wanted to
      see you both married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ella&mdash;Ella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted it, I tell you, not because I loved you, though you know that I
      love you better than anyone in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Ella!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not because I knew that you and he would be happy, but because I wished
      to snatch my own soul from perdition. I think it is safe now&mdash;but oh,
      my God! it is like the souls of many other mortals&mdash;saved in spite of
      myself! Phyllis, you have been my salvation. You are a girl; you cannot
      understand how near a woman may go to the bottomless pit through the love
      of a man. You fancy that love lifts one to the heaven of heavens; that it
      means purity&mdash;self-sacrifice. Well, there is a love that means
      purity; and there is a love that means self-sacrifice. Self-sacrifice:
      that is, that a woman is ready to sacrifice herself&mdash;her life&mdash;her
      soul&mdash;for the man whom she loves. I tell you&mdash;I, who know the
      truth&mdash;I, who have been at the brink. It is not that the pit is dear
      to us; it is that the man is dear to us, and we must go with him,&mdash;wherever
      he goes,&mdash;even down into hell itself with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ella, Ella! this is the love of the satyr. It is not the love of the
      one who is made in the image of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let it be what it is; it is a power that has to be reckoned upon so long
      as we remain creatures of the earth, earthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a thing that we should beat into the earth from which it came.&rdquo; The
      girl had sprung to her feet, and was speaking with white face and clenched
      hands. &ldquo;Down into the earth&rdquo;&mdash;she stamped upon the floor&mdash;&ldquo;even
      if we have to throw our bodies into the grave into which we trample it.
      Woman, I tell you that the other love,&mdash;the love which is the truth,&mdash;is
      stronger than the love of the satyr.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it? is it, Phyllis? Yes, sometimes. Yes; it was a word that you spoke
      in his hearing that saved him&mdash;him&mdash;Herbert&mdash;and that saved
      me that night when I came to you&mdash;when I waited for you&mdash;you did
      not know anything of why I came. I will tell you now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, no! Oh, Ella! for God&rsquo;s sake, tell me nothing! I think I know all
      that I want to know; and I know that you had strength given to you by God
      to come to me that night. I had not to go to you. But I have come to you
      to-night. We are together, you and I; and we are the same as when we were
      girls together&mdash;oh, just the same! Who shall come between us, Ella?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Who? You came here to save me. I knew it. But you had saved me
      before you came. Phyllis, in this very room I was alone with him. I was
      mad&mdash;mad with jealousy at the thought of losing him&mdash;though I
      knew that I had lost him&mdash;I was mad! The passion breathed from the
      roses&mdash;the twilight full of the memories of the spring we spent
      together in Italy&mdash;all took possession of my heart&mdash;my soul. I
      whispered to him to come to me&mdash;to come to me. And he came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cry the girl gave, as she covered her face with her hands and dropped
      back into her chair, was very pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came to me&mdash;but only one step&mdash;one little step, Phyllis;
      then there came before his eyes a vision of your face&mdash;he felt your
      hand&mdash;cool as a lily&mdash;upon his wrist&mdash;he heard your voice
      speaking into his ear; he turned and fled&mdash;fled through that window&mdash;fled
      from the demon that had taken possession of this room&mdash;I said so to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God&mdash;oh, Ella, thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my cry&mdash;thank God&mdash;thank God; and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;God
      help me! I feel ready to throw myself at your feet and say &lsquo;Give him back
      to me! Give him back to me!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had stood with her hands clasped above her head at her first utterance
      of that imploration&mdash;&ldquo;Give him back to me!&rdquo; Then she threw herself on
      her knees and passionately caught both the girl&rsquo;s hands in her own,
      crying, &ldquo;Give him back to me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis flung her arms about her neck, and bowed her own head down to the
      shoulder of the woman whom she loved and pitied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then through the silence of the house&mdash;the hour was almost midnight&mdash;there
      sounded the loud and continuous ringing of a bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only the usual visitors&rsquo; bell of the house; but its effect at that
      hour was startling&mdash;shocking!
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women were on their feet, waiting in silence, but with wildly
      beating hearts, for what was coming&mdash;they felt that something
      terrible was coming. The bell had an ominous jangle. They heard the
      footsteps of the one servant who remained up to put out the lights, going
      to answer the summons of the bell&mdash;they heard a man&rsquo;s voice speaking
      in a low tone in the hall&mdash;they heard a man&rsquo;s steps approach the door
      of their room. The door opened, and Mr. Ayrton appeared before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door slowly, and stood there staring not at his daughter,
      but at Ella Linton. On his face was an expression that Phyllis had never
      seen on it before. It frightened her. She could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there, with his eyes fixed upon Ella Linton&mdash;rigid&mdash;silent
      as a figure that symbolizes Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence became appalling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake speak, if you are living!&rdquo; cried Ella in a whisper
      tremulous with terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not speak&mdash;he stood there, staring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean? What does he mean?&rdquo; said the woman, after another
      dreadful pause. &ldquo;Why does he stand there, Phyllis, staring at me? Why&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
      my God! I see it&mdash;I see it on his face&mdash;my husband&mdash;Stephen&mdash;dead&mdash;he
      is dead&mdash;you came to bring the news to me. Look, Phyllis, he cannot
      say &lsquo;No&rsquo;&mdash;he would say &lsquo;No&rsquo; unless I had guessed the truth&mdash;he
      would say it&mdash;he would have some pity. Is it the truth? Man&mdash;speak&mdash;say
      yes, or no&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake! for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had taken half a dozen rapid steps to him and grasped him by the arm,
      gazing into his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung his arm from her, and burst into a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Phyllis! I see it all now. He was the man I loved&mdash;I know it now&mdash;he
      was the man I loved. It was for him I cried out just now&mdash;&lsquo;Give him
      back to me&mdash;give him back to me!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The wild shriek with which she cried the words the second time rang
      through the house. She fell upon her knees, clutching at Phyllis&rsquo; hand as
      before, and then, making a motion as if about to rise, she fell back and
      lay with her white face turned to the ceiling, her white arms stretched
      limply out on each side of her like the arms of a crucified woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Servants came with restoratives.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IF GOD WOULD ONLY GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE!
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor creature! Poor creature!&rdquo; said Mr. Ayrton. He had just returned from
      the room to which they had carried Ella. Phyllis was lying on the sofa
      with her face down to the pillow. &ldquo;Poor creature! No one could have had
      any idea that she was so attached to him! She will be one of the richest
      women in England. He fell down in the club between nine and ten. His
      heart. Sir Joseph was not surprised. He said he had told him a short time
      ago that he had not six months to live. He cannot have let his wife know.
      Well, well, perhaps it was for the best. His man came to me in a terrible
      state. How was it to be broken to her? I just managed to catch the last
      train. He must have been worth over a million. She will be one of the
      richest women in England. Even in America a woman with three-quarters of a
      million is reckoned moderately well off. Poor creature! Ah! the shorn
      lamb!&mdash;the wind is tempered. &lsquo;In the midst of life&mdash;&rsquo; Dear
      Phyllis! you must not allow yourself to break down. Your sympathetic
      nature is hard to control, I know, but still&mdash;oh, my child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Phyllis refused to be comforted. She lay sobbing on the pillow, and
      when her father put his arm about her and raised her, she put her head on
      his shoulder, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is gone from me forever&mdash;he is gone from me forever! Oh, I am the
      cruelest woman on earth! It is not for her terrible blow that I am crying,
      it is because I have lost him&mdash;I see it&mdash;I have lost him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her father became frightened. What in the world could she mean by talking
      about the man being gone from her? He had never heard of a woman&rsquo;s
      sympathy extending to such limits as caused her to feel a personal
      deprivation when death had taken another woman&rsquo;s husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am selfish&mdash;cruel&mdash;heartless!&rdquo; sobbed Phyllis. &ldquo;I thought
      of myself, not of her. He is hers; he will be given back to her as she
      prayed&mdash;she prayed so to me before you appeared at the door, papa.
      &lsquo;Give him back to me! Give him back to me!&rsquo; that was her prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dearest child, you must not talk that way,&rdquo; said the father. &ldquo;Come,
      Phyllis, your strength has been overtaxed. You must go to bed and try to
      sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She still moaned about her cruelty&mdash;her selfishness, until the doctor
      who had been sent for and had been with Ella in her room, appeared in
      order to let them know that Mrs. Linton had regained consciousness. The
      blow had, of course, been a terrible one: but she was young, and Nature
      would soon reassert herself, he declared, whatever he meant by that. He
      thought it strange, he said, that Mrs. Linton had not been aware of her
      husband&rsquo;s weakness. To him, the physician, the condition of the
      unfortunate gentleman had been apparent from the first moment he had seen
      him. He had expected to hear of his death any day. He concluded by
      advising Phyllis to go to bed and have as long a sleep as possible. He
      would return in the morning and see if Mrs. Linton might travel to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis went to her room, and her father went to the one which had been
      prepared for him. For a minute or two he remained thoughtful. What could
      his daughter have meant by those self-accusations? After a short time,
      however, he smiled. The poor thing had been upset by the shocking news of
      the death of the husband of her dearest friend. She was sympathetic to
      quite a phenomenal degree. That sympathy which felt her friend&rsquo;s loss as
      though it were wholly her own was certainly not to be met with every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Phyllis showed traces of having spent a bad night. But she
      spoke rationally and not in the wild way in which she had spoken before
      retiring, and her father felt that there was no need for him to be uneasy
      in regard to her condition. He allowed her to go to the side of her
      friend, Ella, and as he was leaving them together in each other&rsquo;s arms, he
      heard Ella say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Phyllis, I know it now. He was the man who had all my love&mdash;all&mdash;all!
      Ah, if God would only give me another chance&mdash;one more chance!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton had heard that passionate appeal for another chance upon more
      than one previous occasion. He had heard the husband who had tortured his
      wife to death make a passionate appeal to God to give him another chance.
      He knew that God had never given him another chance with the same wife;
      but God had given him another wife in the course of time&mdash;a wife who
      was not made on the spiritual lines of those who die by torture; a wife
      who was able to formulate a list of her own rights, and the rights of her
      sisters, and who possessed a Will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who wanted another chance had no chance with such a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had heard the wife, who had deserted her husband in favor of the
      teetotal platform, cry out for another chance, when her husband had died
      away from her. But God had compassion upon the husband. She did not get
      him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pitied with all his heart the poor woman who would be one of the
      richest women in England in the course of a day or two, and he said so to
      Mr. Courtland when he called early in the morning. Mr. Courtland did not
      remain for long in the house. It might have been assumed that so intimate
      a friend of Mr. and Mrs. Linton&rsquo;s would be an acceptable visitor to the
      widow; but Mr. Courtland knew better. He hurried away to town without even
      asking to see her. He only begged of Mr. Ayrton to let him know if he
      could be of any use in town&mdash;there were details&mdash;ghastly; but he
      would take care that there was no inquest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis went up to town with poor Ella, and remained by her side in that
      darkened house through all the terrible days that followed. Mr. Linton&rsquo;s
      death had an appreciable influence upon the quarter&rsquo;s revenue of the
      country. The probate duty paid by the executors was a large fortune in
      itself, and Ella was, as Mr. Ayrton had predicted she would be, one of the
      richest women in England. The hundred thousand pounds bequeathed to some
      unostentatious charities&mdash;charities that existed for the cause of
      charity, not for the benefit of the official staff&mdash;made no
      difference worth speaking of in the position of Mrs. Linton as one of the
      richest women in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the codicil to the will which surprised most people was that which
      placed in the hands of Mrs. Linton and the Rev. George Holland as joint
      trustees the sum of sixty thousand pounds, for the building and endowment
      of a church, the character and aims of which would be in sympathy with the
      principles recently formulated by the Rev. George Holland in his book
      entitled &ldquo;Revised Versions,&rdquo; and in his magazine article entitled &ldquo;The
      Enemy to Christianity,&rdquo; the details to be decided by the Rev. George
      Holland and Mrs. Linton as joint trustees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The codicil was, of course, a very recent one; but it was executed in
      proper form; it required two pages of engrossing to make the testator&rsquo;s
      desires plain to every intelligence that had received a thorough training
      in legal technicalities. It was susceptible of a good deal of
      interpretation to an ordinary intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was explained to Mrs. Linton, she also was at first a good deal
      surprised. It read very like a jest of some subtlety: for she had no idea
      that her husband had the slightest feeling one way or another on the
      subject of the development of one Church or another; and as for the
      establishment of an entirely new Church&mdash;yes, it struck her at first
      that her solicitor was making a bold and certainly quite an unusual
      attempt to cheer her up in her bereavement by bringing under her notice a
      jest of the order <i>pachydermato</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But soon it dawned upon her that her husband meant a good deal by this
      codicil of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am getting to understand him better every day,&rdquo; she said to Phyllis.
      &ldquo;He knew that I loved him and him only. He has given me this work to do,
      and with God&rsquo;s help I will do it thoroughly. You did not believe in the
      value of George Holland&rsquo;s doctrines. Neither did I: I never thought about
      them. I will accept my husband&rsquo;s judgment regarding them, and perhaps I
      may think about them later on. Our Church will be the most potent
      influence for good that the century has yet seen. Yes, I will throw myself
      heart and soul into the work. After all, it must be admitted that the
      Church has never done its duty as a Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Rev. George Holland had a good deal to say on the subject of the
      codicil, when he was alone with Mrs. Linton, a few days later. He had by
      no means made up his mind to sever his connection with the dear old mother
      Church, he said. He could not see that there was any need for his taking
      so serious a step&mdash;an irrevocable step. It was his feeling at that
      moment, he declared, that he might be able to effect the object of his
      life&mdash;which was, of course, the reform of the Church&mdash;better by
      remaining within its walls than by severing himself from it. He must take
      time to consider his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left Mrs. Linton greatly disappointed. It had been her belief that Mr.
      Holland would jump at the chance&mdash;that was the phrase which she
      employed in expressing her disappointment to Phyllis&mdash;of becoming the
      founder of a brand-new religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was greatly disappointed in Mr. Holland. If Buddha or Edward Irving,
      or some of the other founders of new religions had had such a chance
      offered to them in early life, would they not have embraced it eagerly?
      she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was to be such a striking Church! She had made up her mind to that.
      It was to be a lasting memorial to the largeness of soul of her husband&mdash;to
      his appreciation of the requirements of the thinking men and women of the
      age. She had made up her mind already as to the character of the painted
      windows. The church would itself, of course, be the purest Gothic. As for
      the services, she rather thought that the simplicity of the Early Church
      might be effectively combined with some of the most striking elements of
      Modern Ritualism. However, that would have to be decided later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the bishop heard of the codicil he had another interview with
      George Holland, and imparted to that young cleric his opinion that he
      should avail himself of the opportunity offered to him of trying what
      would undoubtedly be a most interesting experiment, and one to the
      carrying out of which all true churchmen would look forward most
      hopefully. Who could say, he inquired, if the larger freedom which would
      be enjoyed by an earnest, sincere, and highly intellectual clergyman, not
      in immediate contact with the Establishment, might not avail him to
      perfect such a scheme of reform as would eventually be adopted by the
      Church?
    </p>
    <p>
      That interview was very helpful to George Holland in making up his mind on
      the subject of the new Church. He resigned his pastorate, greatly to the
      regret of the churchwardens; though no expression of such regret was ever
      heard from the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then a bishop is supposed to have his feeling thoroughly under
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened three weeks after the death of Stephen Linton, and during
      these weeks Herbert Courtland had never once asked to see Ella Linton.

      CHAPTER XXXVI.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MARRIAGE IS THE PICTURESQUE GATEWAY LEADING TO A COMMONPLACE ESTATE.
    </h3>
    <p>
      So soon as Phyllis Ayrton had returned home, she got a letter from Herbert
      Courtland, asking her if she would be good enough to grant him an
      interview. She replied at once that it would please her very much to see
      him on the following afternoon&mdash;she was going to Scotland with her
      father in a week, if Parliament had risen by that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to her. She was alone in the drawing room where she had always
      received him previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant had scarcely left the room before he had told her he had come
      to tell her that he loved her&mdash;to ask her if he might hope to have
      some of her love in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not seated himself, nor had she. They remained standing together in
      the middle of the room. He had not even retained her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you come to me&mdash;to <i>me</i>?&rdquo; she asked him. Her face was
      pale and her lips, when he had been speaking to her, were firmly set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to you, not because I am worthy of the priceless gift of your
      love,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but because you have taught me not merely to love you&mdash;you
      have taught me what love itself is. You have saved my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no! do not say that; it pains me,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot but say it; it is the truth. You have saved me from a
      degradation such as you could not understand. Great God! how should I feel
      to-day if you had not come forward to save me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He walked away from her. He stood with his back turned to her, looking out
      of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained where he had left her. She did not speak. Why should she
      speak?
    </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly faced her once again. The expression upon his face astonished
      her. She had never before seen a man so completely in the power of a
      strong emotion. She saw him making the attempt to speak, but not
      succeeding for some time. Her heart was full of pity for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you cannot understand,&rdquo; he managed to say. &ldquo;You cannot
      understand, and I cannot, I dare not, try to explain anything of the peril
      from which you snatched me. You know nothing of the baseness, the cruelty,
      of a man who allows himself to be swayed by his own passions. But you
      saved me&mdash;you saved me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank God for that,&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;But you must not come to me to
      ask me for my love. It is not to me you should come. It is for her who was
      ready to sacrifice everything for you. You must go to her when the time
      comes, not now&mdash;she has not recovered from her shock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know&mdash;she has told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew all that terrible story&mdash;that pitiful story&mdash;before I
      heard it from her lips.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet&mdash;yet&mdash;you could speak to me&mdash;you could be with me
      day after day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know what you would say! You would say that I led you on&mdash;that
      I gave you to believe that I loved you. That is what you would say, and it
      would be the truth. I made up my mind to lead you on; I gave you to
      understand that I cared for you. But I confess to you now that I did so
      because I hoped to save her. You see it was a plot on my part&mdash;the
      plot of one woman anxious to save her sister from destruction. I
      succeeded. Thank God for that&mdash;thank God for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You succeeded&mdash;you succeeded indeed.&rdquo; He spoke slowly and in a low
      tone, his eyes fixed upon her burning face. &ldquo;Yes, you led me on&mdash;you
      led me from earth to heaven. You saved her&mdash;you saved me. That is why
      I am here to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it is not here you should be, Mr. Courtland.&rdquo; She had turned quickly
      away from him with a gesture of impatience and had walked to the other end
      of the room. There was more than a suspicion of indignation in her voice.
      &ldquo;You should be with the woman whom you loved; the woman who showed you how
      she loved you; the woman who was ready to give up everything&mdash;honor&mdash;husband&mdash;God&mdash;for
      you. Go to her&mdash;to her&mdash;when the numbness has passed away from
      her, and there is no barrier between you and her. That is all I have to
      say to you, Mr. Courtland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it indeed all, Phyllis?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But you will let me speak to you.
      You will let me ask if Ella alone was ready to sacrifice herself? You say
      that you led me to love you in order to save her. How did you lead me on?
      By giving me to understand that you were not indifferent to me&mdash;that
      you had some love for me. Let me ask you if you were acting a lie at that
      time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to save her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you succeeded. Were you acting a lie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were willing to save her?&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;How did you mean to save
      her? Were you prepared to go to the length of marrying me when I had been
      led on to that point by you? Answer me, Phyllis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not answer you, Mr. Courtland&mdash;you have no right to ask me to
      answer you. One terrible moment had changed all the conditions under which
      we were living. If she had been free,&mdash;as she is now,&mdash;do you
      fancy for a moment that I should have come between you&mdash;that I should
      have tried to lead you away from her? Well, then, surely you must see as
      clearly as I do at the present moment that now our relative positions are
      the same as they would have been some months ago, if Ella had been free&mdash;if
      she could have loved you without being guilty of a crime? Oh, Mr.
      Courtland do not ask me to humiliate myself further. Please go away. Ah,
      cannot you see that it would be impossible for me to act now as I might
      have acted before? Cannot you see that I am not a woman who would be ready
      to steal happiness for myself from my dearest friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I am beginning to see what sort of woman you are&mdash;what sort
      of a being a woman may be. You love me, Phyllis, and yet you will send me
      away from you lest you should do Ella a wrong?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I implore of you to go away from me, because if Ella had been free a
      month ago as she is to-day, she would have married you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she fancied that she loved me a month ago. She knows that she does
      not love me now. You love me&mdash;you, Phyllis, my love, my beloved; you
      dare not say that when you led me to love you, you were not led
      unthinkingly to love me yourself. Will you deny that, my darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had strode passionately up to her, and before she could resist he had
      put his arms about her and was kissing her on the face. For a moment only
      she resisted, then she submitted to his kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are mine&mdash;mine&mdash;mine!&rdquo; he whispered, and she knew that she
      was. She now knew how to account for the brilliant successes of the man in
      places where every other civilized man had perished. He was a master of
      men. &ldquo;You love me, darling, and I love you. What shall separate us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a little cry she freed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said the truth!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;the bitter truth. I love you! I
      love you! I love you! You are my love, my darling, my king forever. But I
      tell you to go from me. I tell you that I shall never steal from any
      sister what is hers by right. I would have sacrificed myself&mdash;I did
      not love you then&mdash;to keep you from her; I am now ready to sacrifice
      myself&mdash;now that I love you&mdash;to give you to her. Ah, my love, my
      own dear love, you know me, and you know that I should hate myself&mdash;that
      I should hate you, too, if I were to marry you, now that she is free. Go,
      my beloved&mdash;go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her face made beautiful with tears. &ldquo;Let me plead with you,
      Phyllis. Let me say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, go! go! go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put out his hand to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am leaving England, but from day to day I shall
      let you know where I am, so that you can send to me when you want me to
      return to you. Write on a paper, &lsquo;Come to me,&rsquo; and I will come, though
      years should pass before I read those words. I deserve to suffer, as I
      know I shall suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out his hand. She took it. Her tears fell upon it. She did not
      speak as he went to the door. Then she gave a cry like the cry of a
      wounded animal. She held out her hands to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet! Not yet!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flung herself into his arms, kissing him and kissing him, holding him
      to her with her arms about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by! Good-by, my darling, my best beloved. Oh, go! Go, Herbert,
      before I die in your arms. Go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was lying along the floor with her head on the sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked wildly around the room, wiping the tears from her eyes. She
      sprang to her feet, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back! Come back to me, my beloved! Oh, I was a fool! Such a fool as
      women are when they think of such things as heaven and truth and right! A
      fool! A fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterward Ella called to say good-by to her. She was going to
      Switzerland first, she said, to a quiet spot that she knew, where she
      might think out some of the details of the Church. Mr. Holland would meet
      her in Italy in the winter to consider some of the architectural details.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hour of her departure was at hand she referred to another matter&mdash;a
      matter on which she spoke much more seriously than she had yet spoken on
      the subject of the Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not go, my dear Phyllis,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;without telling you that I
      know Herbert Courtland will come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Phyllis. &ldquo;He will not come to me. He has been with me. He is
      now gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? That would be impossible!&rdquo; cried Ella. &ldquo;You would not send him
      away. He told you that he loved you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he told me that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you sent him away? Oh, Phyllis, you would not break my heart. I
      know that you love him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do love him. Oh, my Phyllis, I told him months ago that it was the
      dearest wish of my heart to see you married to him. At that time he
      laughed. Oh, it is horrible to me to recall now how he laughed. Shall I
      ever forget that terrible dream? But now he loves you. I know it. What!
      you think him unworthy of you because of&mdash;of that dream which was
      upon us? Phyllis, don&rsquo;t forget that he fought with the sin and overcame
      it. How? Ah! you know how. He overcame the passion that is of earth by the
      love that is of heaven. It was his pure love for you that gave him the
      victory. Why should you send him away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows. He understands. He is gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She held Phyllis&rsquo; hand and looked into her face. She gave a sudden start&mdash;a
      little start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, surely, my Phyllis, you don&rsquo;t think that I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
      no! you cannot think that of me. Oh, my darling, if you should be so
      foolish as to think that I&mdash;that I still&mdash;&mdash;Ah, I cannot
      speak about it. Listen to me, Phyllis: I tell you that as he conquered
      himself by the love which is of heaven, so have I conquered by the same
      Divine Power. The love which is in heaven&mdash;the love which is mine&mdash;has
      given me the victory also. Dear Phyllis, that man is nothing to me to-day.
      I tell you he is nothing&mdash;nothing! Ah, I don&rsquo;t even hate him. If I
      should ever speak to him again it would be to send him back to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis said nothing, and just then her father came into the room, and
      after a few minutes&rsquo; conventional chat Ella went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Ayrton remarked to Phyllis that her dearest friend was looking better
      than she had looked for many months, and then he laughed. Phyllis did not
      like his laugh. She looked at him&mdash;gravely&mdash;reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, my dear,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but I was only thinking that&mdash;well&mdash;that
      she&mdash;&mdash;Ah, after all, what is marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis did not reply. She saw by his eyes that he had found another
      phrase. What were phrases to her?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Marriage is the most honorable preliminary to an effective widowhood,&rdquo;
       said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next eight months Phyllis received many letters from Ella&mdash;some
      from Switzerland, some from Italy, and one from Calcutta. Ella had gone to
      India to make further inquiries on the subject of Buddhism. At any rate,
      no one whose heart was set upon building up a New Church could afford, she
      said, to ignore Buddhism as a power.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holland agreed with her, she said. He had gone through India with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned to England in April, and of course went to see Phyllis
      without delay. Some men had wanted to marry Phyllis during the winter, as
      everybody knew, but she had been pleasantly irresponsive. Some of her
      closest friends (female) laughed and said that she had found out how silly
      she had been in throwing over Mr. Holland.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not, however, of these suitors that Ella talked to her. It was of
      Herbert Courtland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had she heard from him? she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes; he occasionally sent her his address, Phyllis said&mdash;that was
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will write to him to come back to you, Phyllis?&rdquo; said Ella
      entreatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest child,&rdquo; continued Ella, &ldquo;I know the goodness of your heart. I
      know the high ideal of honor and faith which you have set before you. I
      saw Herbert when our steamer stopped at Port Said. He had been in
      Abyssinia&mdash;you know that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I talked with him for an hour,&rdquo; said Ella. &ldquo;He told me a great deal about
      you&mdash;about your parting from him. You will write those words to him
      before I leave this room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you will, when I tell you what I did not tell him&mdash;when I
      tell you that George Holland and I have agreed that our positions as joint
      trustees of the New Church will be immeasurably strengthened if we are
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis had risen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are to be married in three months. The matter is, of course, to remain
      a secret&mdash;people are so given to talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis fell into her arms and kissed her tearfully&mdash;but the tears
      were not all her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you will write those words,&rdquo; said Ella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis ran to a little French escritoire and snatched up a sheet of
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me, my beloved,&rdquo; she wrote upon it; then she leaned her face upon
      her arm, weeping happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ella came behind her. She picked up the paper and folded it up. She
      pressed the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please give that to Mr. Courtland in the study,&rdquo; she said to the servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phyllis sprang up with a cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forgot to tell you, my dearest, that I brought back Herbert Courtland
      in that steamer with me, and that he came with me to-day. He is coming to
      you&mdash;listen&mdash;three steps at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that was just how he did come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; cried Mr. Ayrton, ten minutes later. &ldquo;Bless my soul! I
      always fancied that&mdash;&mdash;Ah, after all, what is marriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Phyllis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last word that can be said regarding it is that marriage is the
      picturesque gateway leading to the commonplace estate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Phyllis

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
